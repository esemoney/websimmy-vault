# 4.601 Assignments

Student learning and assessment in this course occurs primarily through three team project assignments that provide exposure to key methods and challenges in designing human-AI interaction for military decision-making contexts:

|Assignment|Description|Weight|
|---|---|---|
|**Needfinding & Conceptual Design**|- Analyze real-world military AI use case<br>- Conduct cognitive task analysis to understand human decision-making needs & challenges<br>- Develop conceptual human-AI interface design for selected problem space<br><br>_Deliverable:_ Design brief & storyboard (5-7 pages)|20%|
|**Iterative Prototyping**|- Create interactive UI mockups of increasing fidelity<br>- Implement working prototype using modern web stack (HTML/CSS/JS)<br>- Integrate with simulated AI/ML reasoning engine to demonstrate human-autonomy teaming<br><br>_Deliverable:_ Functional UI prototype & technical documentation (GitHub repo)|40%|
|**Evaluation & Demonstration**|- Design and conduct user study with military personnel to evaluate prototype<br>- Analyze feedback data to assess usability, utility, and mission impact<br>- Refine final prototype and present project insights to stakeholders & invited guests<br><br>_Deliverables:_ User study report (5-7 pages) & final demo (15 min presentation)|40%|

**Key Project Milestones & Deadlines:**

- Week 3 - Project teams formed, use case selected
- Week 5 - Conceptual design brief due
- Week 7 - UI mockups v1 presented for feedback
- Week 9 - Working prototype v1 demoed
- Week 11 - User evaluations conducted
- Week 13 - Final prototype & report due

Project deliverables will be evaluated on the following criteria:

- Alignment of problem analysis & design approach with real-world military stakeholder needs
- Application of human-AI interaction principles & cognitive engineering methods
- Technical implementation & demonstration of joint human-machine capabilities
- Insights gained from user tests & impact of iterative design refinements
- Overall creativity, polish, and communication of project artifacts & findings

**Grading Breakdown:**

- Project Deliverables: 80%
    - Needfinding & Conceptual Design Brief: 20%
    - Prototypes & Iterations: 40%
    - User Evaluation Report & Final Demo: 40%
- Individual Participation & Peer Assessment: 20%

Timely submission of all project deliverables is required to receive full credit. Late assignments will be penalized by 10% per day. Exceptions may be granted only in cases of serious illness or emergency.

While collaboration is encouraged, the majority of each assignment should reflect the work of the individual student and their immediate project team. Proper attribution must be given for any external assets, references or contributions from others.
