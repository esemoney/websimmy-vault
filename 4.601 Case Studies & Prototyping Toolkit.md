# 4.601 Case Studies & Prototyping Toolkit

This page provides access to a curated set of military human-AI interaction case studies and UI design templates to support your course projects. Each case provides context on a real-world challenge area where AI-enabled decision support tools could enhance armed forces' capabilities.

The Figma templates offer a starting point for rapidly mocking up intelligent interfaces relevant to the case study domains. You can duplicate and adapt these templates to jumpstart your own design explorations and prototypes.
