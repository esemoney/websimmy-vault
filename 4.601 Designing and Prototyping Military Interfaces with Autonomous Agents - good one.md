# 4.601 Designing and Prototyping Military Interfaces with Autonomous Agents

Instructor(s): Prof. James Bowdon  
Prereq: Permission of instructor  
Units: 3-3-6  
Level: G (Graduate)

This course focuses on the design and prototyping of next-generation command and control (C2) and delegatory interfaces for human-machine teaming in military applications. Students will explore emerging interaction paradigms and develop functioning interface prototypes that leverage autonomous AI agents.

## Course Description

The rise of increasingly capable autonomous systems is transforming the nature of military operations. To effectively harness these systems, new types of interfaces are needed that enable intuitive command and control, dynamic delegation of tasks, and seamless coordination between human operators and AI agents.

In this project-based course, students will investigate novel approaches to C2 interface design, drawing insights from fields such as human-computer interaction, AI, decision theory, and cognitive engineering. Key topics include:

- Mixed-initiative interaction and adjustable autonomy
- Explainable AI and transparency in human-machine interfaces
- Visualizing uncertainty and risk in agent recommendations
- Attention management and interruption in high-tempo operations
- Trust calibration and methods to mitigate automation bias
- Prototyping techniques for futuristic military UIs

Students will work in small teams to concept, design, and develop working prototypes of advanced C2 interfaces for selected military use cases (e.g. UAV swarming, ISR mission planning, cyber defense). Prototypes will be built using modern web technologies and integrate with backend AI/ML systems. Teams will conduct user evaluations of their interface designs with military subject matter experts.

By taking this course, students will gain hands-on experience envisioning and building cutting-edge human-machine interfaces. They will grapple with the complex interaction challenges raised by increasingly autonomous military systems. The course will prepare students to pioneer innovative approaches to human-AI collaboration for defense and national security applications.

## Assignments

There will be three main project deliverables:

|Assignment|Due|Weight|
|---|---|---|
|Domain Analysis and Need-Finding|Week 3|20%|
|Interface Design and Prototyping|Week 7|40%|
|Evaluation and Demonstration|Week 12|40%|

Additional details on each assignment will be provided in class. Teams will present their projects during an end-of-term showcase event.

## Grading

Grading will be based on the quality of project deliverables (80%) and individual class participation (20%). There are no exams.

## Required Textbooks

There are no required textbooks for this class. Readings will be assigned from academic papers, industry reports, and military doctrine documents.

## Software

Students are expected to be proficient in basic web development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). Experience with UI development frameworks like React or Vue is recommended. Some familiarity with AI/ML techniques is also beneficial but not required.

## Other Requirements

To take this course, students must be U.S. citizens or have prior approval. Some project work may require security clearances. For questions about participation requirements, contact the instructor.
