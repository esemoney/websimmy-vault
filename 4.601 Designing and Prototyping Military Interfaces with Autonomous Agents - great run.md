# 4.601 Designing and Prototyping Military Interfaces with Autonomous Agents

**Instructor:** Prof. James Bowdon  
**Prereq:** Permission of instructor  
**Units:** 3-3-6  
**Level:** Graduate

## Course Description

In this project-based course, students will take a deep dive into the human-computer interaction challenges and opportunities presented by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in military systems. Drawing insights from cognitive engineering, interface design, and AI/ML, project teams will prototype cutting-edge user interfaces that enable effective human collaboration with increasingly autonomous technologies in selected military mission contexts.

Through lectures, case studies, and hands-on design work, the course will explore key topics such as:

- Frameworks for analyzing human-AI function allocation and dynamic task delegation
- Design of transparent interfaces that enable appropriate trust in AI decision support
- Attention management and interruption strategies for human supervisory control of multi-agent systems
- Rapid UI prototyping and evaluation methods for envisioning joint human-machine systems of the future

Students will work in small teams to design, develop, and test functional mockups of advanced human-AI interfaces for real-world use cases such as UAV swarm control, cyber anomaly triage, predictive maintenance planning, and more. Interfaces will be built with modern web technologies and connect to simulated AI reasoning engines to demonstrate human-autonomy teaming concepts. Projects will culminate in user evaluations with military subject matter experts.

By participating in this course, students will gain essential skills in user-centered design, prototyping, and evaluation of AI-enabled systems that can be applied to many domains. They will also develop a rich understanding of the practical challenges and opportunities in human-AI interaction that will help position them as future leaders in the field.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Critically analyze human-computer interaction challenges in deploying AI in complex military decision-making contexts
2. Apply user-centered design methods and cognitive engineering principles to prototype advanced human-AI decision support interfaces
3. Develop working UI prototypes that demonstrate human-AI teaming by integrating front-end designs with simulated AI/ML backends
4. Design and execute evaluation studies with representative users to assess the effectiveness and mission impact of AI-mediated tools
5. Communicate HCI design insights to drive development of AI systems that optimize human-machine collaboration

## Prerequisites

Formal coursework in human-computer interaction and cognitive engineering is beneficial but not required. Programming skills and experience developing web-based user interfaces is expected. Familiarity with key AI/ML concepts and applications is also needed to effectively design human-centered AI systems.

Permission of the instructor is required for enrollment. Interested students should describe relevant background and skills in a brief email to the teaching staff.

## Measurable Outcomes

Student progress against the learning objectives will be assessed through three main team project assignments:

|Project|Topics|Deliverable|Weight|
|---|---|---|---|
|Needfinding & Conceptual Design|Military AI use case analysis, cognitive task analysis, conceptual UI design|Design brief & storyboard|20%|
|Prototyping & Development|Iterative UI prototyping, front-end development, simulated AI back-end integration|Working UI implementation|40%|
|Evaluation & Demonstration|Human-in-the-loop testing, military SME feedback, data analysis & final demo|User study report & demo|40%|

## Grading

- Project deliverables: 80%
- Participation & peer assessment: 20%

Team project deliverables will be graded based on: a) soundness of HCI/UX analysis and conceptual design (25%), b) UI prototype functionality, creativity, and technical implementation (50%), and c) user evaluation insights and demonstration of human-AI interaction concepts (25%).

Students will complete confidential peer evaluations to assess individual contributions to team deliverables. Significant discrepancies in participation may lead to adjustments in final grades. There are no exams.

## Course Materials

There is no required textbook. Readings will be assigned from recent academic papers, industry publications, and military reports on relevant human-AI interaction topics. References will be posted on the course website.

Students will also get access to UI design and prototyping resources such as wireframing tools (e.g. Figma, Balsamiq), front-end code frameworks (e.g. React, Vue), and AI/ML API sandboxes as needed for projects.

## Expectations

Students are expected to attend all class sessions, actively engage in discussions and group work, and meet all project milestones. Assigned readings should be completed before class. Meaningful participation in lectures, case study analyses, and workshops is essential.

Collaboration with military stakeholders, domain experts, and end users will be required for project work. Students will need to be respectful of the time and inputs of external partners. All information shared should be treated as potentially sensitive unless explicitly noted otherwise.

Prototypes and other interim deliverables will be presented for regular feedback from instructors, peers, and invited guests. Students should be prepared to give and receive constructive critiques in formal design reviews as well as informal interactions throughout the process.

## Academic Integrity

Students are expected to adhere to MIT's standards for academic integrity and responsible conduct of research at all times. While collaboration is encouraged, all project deliverables should reflect the work of the individual student or their immediate project team. Any external assets or references used should be properly cited.

The exchange of any classified or sensitive information is strictly prohibited. Students must ensure all project materials are approved for unclassified public release.
