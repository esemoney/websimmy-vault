This project-based course explores the design and prototyping of next-generation command and control (C2) interfaces that leverage artificial intelligence to enable fluid human-machine teaming in military decision-making contexts. Through lectures, case studies, and hands-on development, students will learn to craft software user experiences that enhance human supervision of - and collaboration with - increasingly autonomous systems on the battlefield.

**Key Aspects:**

- Hands-on prototyping of futuristic human-AI interfaces using web technologies
- Exposure to real-world military AI use cases and domain experts
- Emphasis on user-centered design and evaluation with military stakeholders
- Interdisciplinary approach grounded in HCI, AI, cognitive engineering, and more
- Open to all technical graduate students with strong programming skills and interest in national security

By participating in this course, students will gain essential skills in envisioning, developing, and testing joint human-machine decision support tools that address practical needs in defense. They will build an understanding of the interaction challenges raised by increasingly intelligent and autonomous technologies, and learn how user experience design can promote effective human-AI collaboration in high-consequence settings.

Student projects will involve needfinding with military stakeholders, rapid UI prototyping, system development with simulated AI backends, and user evaluations to assess the mission impact of solutions. Domains of focus may include intelligence analysis, tactical planning, cyber operations, UAV swarms, and predictive logistics, among others.

Graduates of the course will be well-prepared to pioneer human-centered AI solutions at the frontiers of national security, as well as to apply design best practices to a wide range of other complex human-machine teaming applications.
