This course explores the design and prototyping of next-generation command and control (C2) and delegatory interfaces for human-machine teaming in military applications. Students will investigate emerging interaction paradigms and develop functioning interface prototypes that leverage autonomous AI agents to enable more fluid and effective coordination on the battlefield.

**Key Aspects of the Course:**

- Innovative project-based course focused on human-AI interaction for military systems
- Open to graduate students with web development skills and interest in national security technology
- Hands-on development of futuristic UI prototypes integrated with AI backend systems
- Exposure to real-world military use cases and subject matter experts
- Interdisciplinary approach drawing on HCI, UX, AI, cognitive engineering, and other fields

## Course Description

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence is transforming the conduct of warfare. Increasingly autonomous systems are being deployed across all domains - air, land, sea, space, and cyber. To effectively leverage these game-changing capabilities, the interfaces used to command and control AI-enabled assets must evolve. A new generation of joint human-machine decision support tools is needed to enable intuitive control, fluid delegation of tasks, and calibrated trust in AI reasoning and behaviors.

In this project-based course, students will take a deep dive into the human-computer interaction challenges and opportunities presented by the rise of AI in military contexts. Drawing insights from fields like cognitive systems engineering, explainable AI, and interface design, project teams will conceptualize and prototype cutting-edge interfaces that maximize human-AI collaboration in selected military problem domains.

Specific topics to be explored include:

- Frameworks for human-AI task allocation and dynamic delegation of control
- Interface design patterns for visualizing machine reasoning and decision uncertainties
- Attention management and interruption strategies for multi-agent supervisory control
- Interaction techniques for eliciting and calibrating appropriate levels of user trust in AI
- Rapid UI prototyping tools and methodologies for envisioning advanced AI-enabled systems
- Evaluation approaches for assessing joint human-machine decision-making performance

Studying real-world use cases, students will work in small teams to design, develop, and test functional prototypes of advanced human-AI interfaces tuned to the unique challenges of the chosen military mission context (e.g. UAV swarm tactics planning, cyber anomaly detection, intel data triage, etc.). Interfaces will be implemented using modern web technologies and integrated with simulated AI/ML backend systems. Projects will culminate in user evaluations conducted with military subject matter experts to gather feedback on the effectiveness and potential mission impact of the prototyped AI-enabled decision support tools.

By participating in this course, students will gain hands-on experience envisioning and implementing next-generation human-AI interaction paradigms for the battlefields of tomorrow. They will develop essential skills in user-centered design, rapid prototyping, and evaluation that can be applied to a wide range of human-machine teaming contexts beyond the military domain.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Critically analyze the human performance challenges and interaction bottlenecks that can arise when increasingly autonomous AI systems are deployed in military contexts
2. Apply cognitive engineering analysis techniques and user-centered design methodologies to prototype intuitive joint human-AI decision interfaces
3. Implement working UI prototypes that integrate modern front-end web technologies with simulated AI/ML reasoning engines
4. Design and execute human-in-the-loop evaluation studies to assess the effectiveness, usability, and mission impact of AI-mediated decision support tools
5. Communicate HCI/UX design insights and tradeoffs to diverse stakeholders including military program managers, engineers, and end users

## Prerequisites

To succeed in this course, students should have:

- Strong programming skills in web development languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Experience with a modern UI framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.js
- Familiarity with user-centered design principles and practices
- Exposure to key AI/ML concepts and application areas
- Ability to quickly prototype software concepts and gather user feedback to drive iteration
- Passion for creatively solving complex interaction challenges

Formal background in HCI and cognitive engineering is beneficial but not required. Enrollment is limited and requires permission of the instructor. Contact the teaching staff if you have questions about the participation requirements in light of individual background and interests.

## Student Projects

Learning and assessment will primarily occur through three team-based projects:

|Assignment|Description|Weight|
|---|---|---|
|Needfinding & Concept Formulation|Domain analysis, literature review, and conceptual design of joint human-AI interface for selected military use case.|20%|
|Iterative Prototyping|Design and development of UI prototypes of increasing fidelity, integrated with simulated AI/ML backend capabilities.|40%|
|Evaluation & Demonstration|User evaluation study with military SMEs, data analysis, and final project demo to invited stakeholders.|40%|

Teams will provide regular milestone status briefings and receive feedback from the instructors and military domain experts throughout the design process. All projects will be showcased in an interactive demo session during the last week of class.

## Grading Policy

- Final project deliverables: 80% (concept briefing 20%, prototypes and iterations 40%, user evaluation 20%)
- Individual participation and contributions to team: 20%

There will be no exams. Project grades will emphasize the final demos, but teams are expected to show consistent progress and respond to feedback throughout the semester. Peer assessments will be used to adjust individual grades for significant discrepancies in team member contributions.
