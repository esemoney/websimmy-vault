This course explores the design and prototyping of next-generation command and control (C2) and delegatory interfaces for human-machine teaming in military applications. Students will investigate emerging interaction paradigms and develop functioning interface prototypes that leverage autonomous AI agents to enable more fluid and effective coordination on the battlefield.

**Key Information**

- Innovative project-based course on human-AI interaction for the military
- Open to graduate students with web dev skills and interest in national security tech
- Hands-on development of futuristic UI prototypes with AI backends
- Exposure to real-world military use cases and subject matter experts
- Interdisciplinary approach drawing on HCI, AI, decision science, and more

## Course Description

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence is transforming the conduct of warfare. Increasingly autonomous systems are being deployed across all domains - air, land, sea, space, and cyber. To effectively harness these AI-enabled capabilities, the interfaces used to command and control them must evolve. A new generation of joint human-machine decision support tools is needed to enable intuitive control, seamless delegation of tasks, and calibrated trust.

In this project-based course, students will take a deep dive into the human-computer interaction challenges and opportunities presented by military AI systems. Drawing insights from fields like cognitive engineering, explainable AI, and interface design, teams will concept and prototype cutting-edge C2 interfaces that maximize human-machine collaboration.

Specific topics to be explored include:

- Frameworks for human-AI task allocation and dynamic delegation of control
- Interface design patterns for visualizing AI reasoning and uncertainties
- Attention management strategies for multi-agent supervisory control
- Interaction techniques for eliciting and calibrating user trust in AI
- Rapid UI prototyping tools and methods for futuristic designs
- Procedures for evaluating joint human-machine decision interfaces

Studying real-world use cases, students will work in small teams to design and develop working prototypes of advanced human-machine interfaces for selected military missions (e.g. multi-drone operations, ISR data triage, predictive maintenance, etc.). Interfaces will be built using modern web technologies and integrated with notional AI/ML backend systems. Projects will culminate with user evaluations conducted in collaboration with military stakeholders and subject matter experts.

By participating in this course, students will gain hands-on experience envisioning and implementing next-generation human-AI interaction paradigms tuned for the unique challenges of defense applications. They will develop essential skills in user-centered design, prototyping, and evaluation that can be applied to a wide range of human-machine teaming contexts beyond the military.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Critically analyze the human performance and interaction challenges raised by increasingly autonomous military AI systems
2. Apply cognitive engineering principles and human-centered design methodologies to prototype intuitive joint human-machine decision interfaces
3. Implement working interface prototypes that integrate modern front-end web technologies with AI/ML backend systems
4. Design and execute evaluation studies to assess the effectiveness, usability, and mission impact of human-machine interfaces
5. Clearly communicate and advocate for innovative human-AI interaction approaches to military program managers and end users

## Prerequisites

To succeed in this course, students should have:

- Proficiency in web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Familiarity with a modern UI framework such as React, Vue, or Angular
- Exposure to basic AI/ML concepts and techniques
- Ability to rapidly prototype and iterate on design concepts
- Prior coursework in HCI and/or cognitive engineering recommended but not required

Enrollment is limited to graduate students and requires permission of the instructor. Some project work may require U.S. citizenship or security clearances to access sensitive military information. Contact the course staff with any questions about participation requirements.

### Recommended Background

- Undergraduate degree in computer science, software engineering, or related field
- Experience developing web-based user interfaces
- Basic grounding in human-computer interaction principles and practices
- Prior academic/industry exposure to artificial intelligence and its application to complex problems

## Assignments

Student learning and performance will be assessed through three main project deliverables:

|Assignment|Description|Weight|
|---|---|---|
|Analysis and Concept Formulation|Literature review, domain analysis, and conceptual design of human-machine interface for selected military use case.|20%|
|Iterative Prototyping and Refinement|Development and testing of increasingly high-fidelity UI prototypes, including front-end implementation and notional AI back-end.|40%|
|Evaluation and Demonstration|User evaluation study, analysis of results, and final demonstration/presentation to military stakeholders.|40%|

Teams will provide regular milestone updates and receive feedback from instructors and military SMEs throughout the prototyping process. At the end of term, projects will be showcased in a capstone event attended by course staff, MIT researchers, and invited DoD guests and users.

## Course Structure

This is a full-semester course meeting twice a week for 90 minute sessions. Class time will be split between lectures on core topics, case study explorations, project team updates, and in-class design/development work.

Key subject areas to be covered in lectures and readings include:

- Foundations of human-autonomy interaction for military systems
- Cognitive engineering approaches to joint human-AI decision making
- Frameworks for dynamic allocation of functions between humans and machines
- Interface design techniques for transparent and explainable AI
- Attention and interruption management in multi-agent control contexts
- Tools and methods for rapid UI prototyping and evaluation

Students will also participate in several practical tutorials and workshops that provide hands-on exposure to relevant interface design and development technologies, such as:

- Front-end UI frameworks (e.g. React, Vue, Angular)
- Wireframing and visual prototyping tools (e.g. Balsamiq, Sketch, Figma)
- Data visualization libraries (e.g. D3.js, Vega-Lite)
- Conversational interface prototyping (e.g. DialogFlow, Rasa)
- Experiment design and online user testing platforms

A typical week might look something like:

Monday   | Lecture: Explainable AI; Case Study: Military Aircrew Assistants    
         |   - Key XAI approaches, HCI considerations
         |   - Case analysis and derivation of design guidelines
         | Team breakouts: Concept iteration and planning    

Wednesday| Tutorial: Visualizing AI Uncertainties with D3.js
         | Project work: Implementation of UI with notional AI back-end
         | Informal design reviews with instructors and SMEs

## Grading Policy

Final grades will be assessed based on the following breakdown:

- Project deliverables and final demonstration (80%)
- Class participation, readings, and peer feedback (20%)

There will be no exams. Project grades will be weighted toward the final deliverable, but teams are expected to show regular progress and respond to instructor feedback.

This is a team-based course, but individual contributions to group projects will be assessed through peer evaluations at each milestone. Significant discrepancies in team member contributions may result in grade adjustments for individuals.
