# 4.601 Syllabus - Fall 2023

**Instructor:** Prof. James Bowdon  
**Prereq:** Permission of instructor  
**Units:** 3-3-6  
**Level:** G (Graduate)

## Description

This project-based course explores the design and prototyping of next-generation user interfaces that enable effective human collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI) in military decision-making contexts. Through lectures, case studies, and hands-on development, students will learn to craft software experiences that enhance human supervision of - and joint problem solving with - increasingly autonomous systems on the battlefield.

Topics include: user-centered design of AI-enabled tools, human-autonomy task allocation frameworks, interfaces for calibrating trust in AI, attention management with multi-agent control, intelligent UI technologies, and rapid prototyping methods. Domains of focus may include intelligence analysis, mission planning, cyber defense, robotics, predictive maintenance, and more.

Students will work in teams to prototype new interaction paradigms for selected military AI challenges, culminating in user evaluations with armed forces personnel. Web technologies will be used to build front-ends connected to simulated AI services. By participating, students will gain skills core to pioneering human-centered AI in defense and beyond.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this course, students will be able to:

1. Analyze interaction challenges in military human-AI teaming through cognitive engineering methods
2. Design intuitive UIs that enhance human-machine collaboration, promote appropriate reliance on AI, and enable effective supervision of autonomous systems
3. Prototype web-based human-AI decision support tools using front-end frameworks integrated with AI backend services
4. Evaluate the usability and mission effectiveness of AI-mediated interfaces through studies with military end users
5. Apply human-centered principles to envision the next generation of AI-enabled national security tools

## Measurable Outcomes & Grading

Grading will be based on three main team projects, each involving design, development, and evaluation milestones:

|Project|Deliverables|Grade Weight|
|---|---|---|
|Needfinding & Concept Formulation|Domain analysis, design brief, UI storyboards|20%|
|Prototyping & Development|Iterative UI mockups, working prototype with AI backend|40%|
|Evaluation & Demonstration|User study with military SMEs, findings report, final demo|40%|

Project grading will emphasize: a) soundness of cognitive task analysis & UI conceptual design (25%), b) prototype design creativity, user experience, & technical implementation (50%), and c) quality of evaluation study & insights on human-AI interaction (25%).

Confidential peer assessments will be used to adjust individual grades for significant differences in teamwork contributions. There are no exams.

## Prerequisites

Students should have strong programming skills for prototyping interactive web-based systems. Prior coursework in HCI methods, UI design, and key AI/ML concepts is beneficial but not required. Permission of the instructor is necessary for enrollment. In a brief email, please describe your relevant background and interest in the topic.

## Readings & Materials

There is no required textbook. Assigned readings will come from academic papers, military reports, industry publications, and technology blog posts on relevant human-AI interaction topics. An evolving bibliography will be posted on the course site.

Students will also get access to UI prototyping tools like Figma, front-end web frameworks like React, and sandboxes for integrating AI backend services as needed for project development.

## Expectations

Students are expected to proactively engage in class discussions, workshops, and project collaborations with peers, instructors, military stakeholders, and end users. Assigned materials must be read before class.

Project milestones will include regular design reviews and feedback sessions with armed forces personnel. Interim deliverables and final prototypes should be of sufficient quality to demo to external stakeholders.

Students must respect the sensitive nature of military problem contexts and ensure any public materials are approved for unclassified release. Flexibility to learn and creatively apply unfamiliar concepts from AI, cognitive engineering, and other fields is key.
