# A Beginner's Guide to Designing Human-AI Interfaces for the Military

Dear students,

Welcome to 4.601! If you're new to the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) and feeling a bit overwhelmed by the prospect of designing cutting-edge user interfaces for artificial intelligence systems in the military domain - don't worry, you're not alone. This class attracts students from diverse backgrounds, many with little to no prior experience in UI/UX design or the unique challenges of the defense world. The key is to approach the learning journey with curiosity, openness, and a willingness to step outside your comfort zone.

So what can you expect in 4.601, and how can you make the most of this experience? Here are a few key things to keep in mind:

## Embrace the interdisciplinary nature of the work

Designing effective human-AI interfaces sits at the intersection of multiple fields - HCI, AI/ML, cognitive science, design, and domain-specific knowledge (in our case, military decision-making). You don't need to be an expert in all these areas coming in, but you should be ready to engage with concepts and methods from across disciplines. We'll provide plenty of resources and structure to support your learning, but the real magic happens when you start to connect the dots yourself.

Aim to build a "T-shaped" skill set - develop depth in your core area of strength, while cultivating breadth to collaborate effectively across domains.

## Ground yourself in real-world needs and context

It's easy to get swept up in the "cool factor" of AI and lose sight of the actual humans who will use the systems you design. That's why a core tenet of this class is focusing the HCI lens on real-world, mission-critical problems. Through project partnerships, case studies, and domain experts, you'll dive deep into the operational challenges and constraints that warfighters face. This context is essential for ensuring your design work is not just innovative but practically relevant.

## Use low-fidelity prototyping to learn fast

One of the most powerful tools in the HCI toolkit is rapid prototyping - the ability to quickly translate ideas into tangible artifacts that can be tested and refined. Don't get hung up on creating pixel-perfect mockups or fully functional code (at least not right away). Simple sketches, storyboards, and clickable wireframes are often more than enough to convey a concept and get valuable feedback. Embrace a "fail fast" mindset and use lightweight prototypes to accelerate your learning cycles.

## Reflect critically on the societal implications

The military is a high-stakes domain where the technologies we create can have profound consequences. As you design human-AI interfaces, it's crucial to grapple with the broader ethical and societal implications. How might your work impact issues of human agency, accountability, privacy, or fairness? These are not easy questions, but engaging with them head-on will make you a more thoughtful and responsible designer. We'll have plenty of opportunities for critical reflection throughout the class.

Always keep in mind the "human" in human-computer interaction. The ultimate goal is not just to make the technology work, but to support human values and flourishing.

## Lean on your classmates and teaching team

Finally, remember that you're not in this alone. Your classmates are an incredible resource - learn from each other's diverse perspectives and skill sets. Don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it, whether on a technical issue or a conceptual roadblock. The teaching staff is here to support your growth, and we're invested in seeing every student succeed.

More than anything, have fun and let your creativity shine! This is a unique opportunity to shape the future of human-machine collaboration in service of the greater good. The road ahead may be challenging at times, but the payoff - in terms of the impact you can have and the personal and professional growth you'll experience - is well worth it.

I look forward to embarking on this journey together.

Onward,  
Prof. Bowdon
