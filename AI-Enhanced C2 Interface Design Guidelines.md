## Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive set of interaction design guidelines for AI-enhanced command and control (C2) interfaces. It synthesizes insights from multiple detailed case studies to identify key design principles. Mini case studies and an interactive prototype are included to illustrate the guidelines in practice.

## Key Design Principles for AI-Enhanced C2 Interfaces

![Diagram showing the 5 key design principles for AI-enhanced C2 interfaces: 1) Provide situational awareness, 2) Support decision making, 3) Enable human-AI collaboration, 4) Ensure transparency and explainability, 5) Adapt to dynamic mission needs](https://mcoai.dplmi.mit.edu/assets/c2-interface-design-principles.png)

Fig 1. Five key design principles for AI-enhanced C2 interfaces.

1. **Provide Situational Awareness:** Interfaces should fuse data from multiple sources into a common operational picture that keeps operators informed of the real-time state of assets, threats, and the environment.
2. **Support Decision Making:** AI-powered decision support tools, such as recommender systems and what-if analysis aids, should be tightly integrated to assist operators in rapidly making sense of complex situations and evaluating courses of action.
3. **Enable Human-AI Collaboration:** Interfaces need to facilitate smooth, mixed-initiative collaboration between human operators and AI agents, with the ability to flexibly adjust the level of automation to suit the context.
4. **Ensure Transparency & Explainability:** To promote trust and acceptance, interfaces should provide mechanisms for operators to inspect the rationale behind AI-generated recommendations and predictions.
5. **Adapt to Dynamic Mission Needs:** C2 interfaces should be able to adapt their content, layout, and functionality based on the current mission phase, operator role and preferences, and available data sources.

## Mini Case Studies

The following table summarizes key takeaways from two representative mini case studies of AI-enhanced C2 interfaces in different domains:

|Case Study|Description|Key AI-Enhanced Features|
|---|---|---|
|Autonomous Logistics Planning System|A C2 interface for dynamically scheduling and routing autonomous cargo UAVs for tactical resupply missions in an A2/AD environment|- AI-optimized resupply schedules and routes based on real-time asset, threat, and demand data<br>- Recommends load configurations to maximize utilization<br>- Adaptive replanning to handle contingencies|
|Coalition Stability Operations HQ|A C2 system for planning and executing multi-national humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operations|- Intelligent fusion of coalition partner data into a shared COP<br>- Automated triage and tasking recommender<br>- Machine translation of plan documents and chat|

## Interactive Prototype

Explore this interactive prototype to see how an notional AI-enhanced C2 interface for an air operations center could apply the identified design guidelines:

Key features include:

- A smart COP that overlays AI-generated alerts and predictions
- Real-time asset tracking with AI-powered health monitoring and maintenance forecasts
- A task planning decision aid that recommends asset assignments and mission parameters
- Embedded what-if wargaming tools for COA comparison
- Role and mission-adaptive interface views
