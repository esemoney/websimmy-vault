## Objective

The goal of this assignment is for you to analyze and compare different human-autonomy interaction paradigms in terms of their suitability for a specific application domain. You will select an autonomous system use case, propose two alternative interaction models, and evaluate their respective strengths and weaknesses through the lenses of situational awareness, human agency, mental model alignment, and workload.

## Instructions

1. **Pick an application area.** Select a domain where autonomous systems are being utilized or have future potential. Some examples:
    - Autonomous vehicles (cars, drones, spacecraft, underwater)
    - Robotic teammates (industrial, military, space exploration)
    - Intelligent decision support (healthcare, finance, cybersecurity)
    - Smart home/building automation
2. **Define the operational context & requirements.** Describe the key tasks the human and autonomous agent must perform together. Consider factors such as:
    - Time criticality and decision frequency
    - Uncertainty and dynamicism of environment
    - Consequences of errors or failures
    - Level of human expertise
    - Degree of autonomy and adaptive automation needs
3. **Propose two human-autonomy interaction paradigms.** Describe two contrasting approaches for structuring the role allocation and communication between the human and autonomous agent for this context. These could be based on existing frameworks, such as:
    
    - Direct teleoperation vs. supervisory control
    - Adaptive vs. adaptable automation
    - Human-on-the-loop vs. human-in-the-loop control
    - Peer-to-peer collaboration vs. hierarchical delegation
    
    For each paradigm, specify:
    1. Allocation of functions between human & autonomy
    2. Interaction modalities and frequencies
    3. Key information exchanges & level of agent transparency
    4. Approach to control transitions & human intervention
4. **Evaluate the interaction paradigms.** Analyze the pros and cons of each paradigm along the following dimensions:
    - _Situational awareness:_ How well does the interaction model support the human's understanding of the agent's status, environment, decision factors, and projected actions? Consider information presentation, level of detail, and refresh rate.
    - _Human agency:_ To what degree does the human remain "in control" and able to influence the agent's behavior? Is there a clear accountability and the ability to intervene as needed?
    - _Mental model alignment:_ How well will the human's understanding of the agent's capabilities, limitations, and internal logic match reality under this paradigm? What gaps or misalignments could arise?
    - _Workload:_ How cognitively and temporally demanding is the interaction model for the human? Consider task complexity, the pace of interaction, and potential decision fatigue.
5. **Recommend a design direction.** Based on your evaluation, which human-autonomy interaction paradigm do you believe is best suited for your chosen application context and why? Are there aspects you would modify or hybridize to arrive at an optimal approach? Justify your reasoning.

## Deliverable

Your submission should be a 3-4 page paper (single spaced, 12 pt font) including any supporting diagrams of the interaction models. Specifically, it should include:

1. A description of your selected application area and the human-autonomy teaming scenario, including key operational requirements and constraints.
2. An explanation and justification of the two contrasting HAI paradigms you've selected to analyze, specifying the key aspects of each as outlined in Step 3.
3. Your evaluation of the paradigms along the situational awareness, human agency, mental model, and workload dimensions. Discuss both strengths and limitations.
4. Your recommendation and rationale for an interaction model best suited to the application, either by selecting one of the analyzed paradigms or proposing a hybrid approach. Explain your reasoning grounded in HAI principles.

You are encouraged to include conceptual diagrams, comparative tables, or design sketches to illustrate your interaction paradigms and analyses, but these visuals should supplement, not substitute, the core text.

## Grading Criteria

The assignment will be evaluated on the following criteria:

- Clarity of problem description and use case selection (10 pts)
- Comprehensiveness and specificity of proposed interaction paradigms (20 pts)
- Insightfulness and balance of paradigm evaluation, tied to HAI principles (30 pts)
- Strength of recommendation rationale and connection to evaluation (20 pts)
- Overall coherence, specificity, and polish of writing and visuals (20 pts)

## Tips

- Ground your scenarios and analyses in the real capabilities and constraints of the autonomous agents. Don't assume omniscient AI.
- Consider how your interaction models handle both nominal and off-nominal conditions. How is the human brought in to handle corner cases or unexpected events?
- Think about the types of errors or mode confusions that could arise from each interaction paradigm. How are these mitigated?
- Draw upon the readings and lecture concepts we've covered so far. Cite relevant frameworks and studies to back up your arguments.
- Strive for a balanced assessment of the paradigm trade-offs, not just promoting a favored approach. The goal is a reasoned analysis.

Looking forward to reading your analyses! This is a chance to apply the HAI concepts we've been discussing to real-world challenges in human-robot teaming. Please reach out if any questions arise.
