# Assignment 1: Human-Autonomy Interaction Analyses

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to analyze human-autonomy interaction (HAI) challenges and design approaches in two distinct real-world systems. By comparing the HAI paradigms employed in different domains, you will gain an appreciation for how the application context shapes the requirements and strategies for effective human-machine teaming.

## Instructions

Select two of the following human-autonomy interaction case studies to analyze:

1. Tesla Autopilot: Driver interaction with semi-autonomous vehicle control
2. Da Vinci Surgical System: Surgeon's teleoperation of robotic surgery tools
3. NASA Mars Rovers: Ground control team's supervision of planetary rovers
4. Blue Prism Robotic Process Automation: Knowledge worker's use of software bots for business process tasks

For each selected case, your analysis should include:

1. **Operational Context & Requirements (1 page)**
    - Describe the key activities the human and autonomous agent perform together. What are the goals and performance metrics?
    - Characterize key contextual factors such as:
        - Time constraints and decision criticality
        - Uncertainty and dynamicism of task environment
        - Potential failure modes and error consequences
        - Operator expertise and training levels
    - What level and type of autonomous capability does the system provide? Where does it fall on the Parasuraman et al. (2000) 10-level automation taxonomy?
2. **Human-Autonomy Interaction Model (1-2 pages)**
    - How are roles and responsibilities divided between the human operator and autonomous agent? Specify the allocation of Parasuraman et al.'s (2000) 4-stage system functions:
        1. Information acquisition
        2. Information analysis
        3. Decision & action selection
        4. Action implementation
    - Through what modalities and at what frequency do the human and agent interact? Describe key information exchanges.
    - How does the system support the human's situational awareness of the agent's status, environment, decisions, and actions?
    - How are control transitions between the human and agent managed? Can the human intervene and override as needed?
    - To what degree does the system enable the human's understanding of the agent's capabilities, limitations, and behaviors?
3. **Evaluation of Interaction Paradigm (1-2 pages)**
    - What are the key strengths of this HAI model for supporting effective teaming and goal achievement in this domain?
    - What are potential weaknesses or failure points in the model that could degrade human-agent coordination or joint performance?
    - Assess the paradigm in terms of the following HAI performance metrics, citing specific system elements:
        - Human workload & attention allocation
        - Automation transparency & predictability
        - Human-automation trust calibration
        - Human skill retention & adaptive automation
    - Suggest 2-3 design improvements that could enhance the HAI model's support of joint activity in this domain.

## Comparative Analysis (1 page)

After analyzing each case individually, compare and contrast the two HAI paradigms in terms of:

- How the differing operational contexts and requirements shape the interaction model designs
- The paradigms' relative strengths & limitations in supporting human-agent teaming
- Generalizable design principles or patterns that emerge across the cases
- Notable differences in the HAI approaches warranted by the distinct domains

## Deliverable

Assemble your analyses and comparative discussion into a 5-7 page paper (single spaced, 12 pt font). Support your evaluations with specific references to HAI concepts from the readings and lectures. Include illustrative diagrams of the interaction models as appropriate to augment the text.

The assignment will be graded on the following criteria:

- Comprehensive characterization of the interaction context and requirements (20%)
- Thorough and accurate depiction of the HAI model & behaviors (30%)
- Insightful analysis of the paradigm's strengths, limitations & improvement opportunities (30%)
- Meaningful synthesis & comparison of the two case studies (10%)
- Clarity of writing/visuals & linkages to course concepts (10%)

Please reach out if any questions arise as you work on this assignment. I look forward to your HAI case study analyses!
