# Assignment 2: Designing Mental Models for Human-Agent Teaming

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is for you to practice designing user mental models and interaction patterns to facilitate effective human-agent collaboration. You will propose and prototype a mental model and associated UI concepts for an intelligent assistant that helps users accomplish a complex cognitive task. The focus is on shaping the user's understanding of the AI's capabilities, grounding interaction in intuitive metaphors, and building interfaces to calibrate appropriate reliance and trust.

## Instructions

1. **Select a Cognitive Task Domain (1-2 paragraphs)**.
    
    Pick a professional task or decision-making context that involves significant cognitive complexity, contextual interpretation, and/or reasoning under uncertainty. Some potential domains include:
    
    - Financial investing and portfolio management
    - Medical diagnosis and treatment planning
    - Cybersecurity threat detection and response
    - Urban planning and resource allocation
    
    Briefly describe the key activities, knowledge requirements, and challenges of your selected task that could potentially benefit from intelligent decision support.
    
2. **Define the AI Assistant's Functionality (1 page)**.
    
    Envision an AI assistant that could support and enhance the human decision-maker's performance on this task. Specifically:
    
    - What subtasks or cognitive functions would the AI handle? Consider elements like data gathering, option generation, risk analysis, preference elicitation, etc.
    - How would the assistant's capabilities complement and augment, rather than replace, the human's skills and responsibilities?
    - What would be the high-level interaction patterns between the user and agent (e.g., explicit instructing, collaborative dialog, background support)?
    - How might the AI's role shift based on situational factors like task complexity, time pressure, or the user's expertise?
3. **Design the Mental Model (2-3 pages)**
    
    Propose a target mental model you want users to have of the AI assistant that facilitates productive teaming and appropriately calibrated trust. Your mental model design should include:
    
    - Intuitive Metaphor: Develop an overarching metaphor, analogy or persona for the AI that captures its key roles and capabilities in a familiar, relatable way. How does this metaphor shape the user's expectations of and approach to the assistant?
    - Exposing Capabilities & Boundaries: Determine what level of algorithmic transparency is needed for users to sufficiently understand what the AI can and cannot do. What key aspects of its underlying logic, knowledge sources, or confidence estimations should be conveyed?
    - Communicating Uncertainty: Define an approach for surfacing the AI's uncertainties and potential failure modes to users. How can you foster awareness of the AI's limitations without undermining trust?
    - Interaction Patterns: Translate the metaphor into a set of interaction design patterns that reinforce the target mental model. What dialog structures, task allocation rubrics, or feedback mechanisms will facilitate natural coordination?
    - Progressive Disclosure: Map how the mental model may need to evolve as users gain experience with the AI assistant. How might you progressively reveal more nuance or revise the model to match observed behaviors over time?
4. **Mock Up the Interface (2-3 pages of wire frames / sketches)**
    
    Develop a set of interface mockups that illustrate how your target mental model and interaction patterns would be reified in the user experience. Focus on key screens, interaction flows, or design elements that exemplify:
    
    - Orienting users to the AI's role and capabilities during onboarding
    - Visualizing the assistant's task contributions, reasoning process and certainty levels
    - Enabling the user to specify goals, provide input, or give feedback to the AI
    - Surfacing contextually relevant "seams" in the AI model to foster appropriate trust
    - Facilitating fluid task coordination and hand-offs between user and AI
    
    Accompany each mockup with a brief explanation of how the design embodies your mental model and supports productive human-AI collaboration.
    

## Deliverable

Assemble the 4 parts of the assignment into a single document, with the mockups either inline or appended at the end. The total length should be the equivalent of 6-8 pages, recognizing the images will take significant space.

Grading will be based on:

|Criteria|Points|
|---|---|
|Appropriateness and clarity of task domain selection|10|
|Specification of AI assistant role and capabilities in human-AI teaming context|20|
|Coherence and generativity of target mental model|25|
|Grounding of mental model in specific interaction patterns|15|
|Translation of mental model into UI mockups that facilitate productive human-AI collaboration|25|
|Clarity of writing and design communication|5|
|Total|100|

The goal is to practice envisioning mental models and interaction paradigms that extend our notions of human-computer interaction to the realm of AI-infused cognitive tools. Have fun with the assignment, and I look forward to seeing your creative designs!
