# C2 Interaction Design Guidelines for AI-Enhanced Interfaces: Case Studies and Analysis

Tutorial Complete

This report provides a detailed analysis of interaction design guidelines for AI-enhanced command and control interfaces, drawing from a range of real-world case studies. The goal is to identify best practices and common pitfalls in designing effective human-machine collaboration interfaces for military applications.

## 1. Guideline: Provide Contextual Transparency

AI systems should provide operators with clear insight into their decision-making process, including the data sources, algorithms, and constraints that influence their recommendations.

### Mini Case Study: Contextual AI Explanations in Missile Defense System

## 2. Guideline: Enable Collaborative Decision Making

Interfaces should support a fluid back-and-forth between human operators and AI agents, allowing each party to contribute their unique strengths to the decision-making process.

### Mini Case Study: Human-AI Teaming in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Control

## 3. Guideline: Maintain Human Agency

Even as AI systems become more sophisticated, interfaces should ensure that human operators retain ultimate control and the ability to override AI decisions when necessary.

### Mini Case Study: Human Override in Autonomous Targeting System

Summary of key interaction design guidelines for AI-enhanced command and control interfaces.

By analyzing real-world case studies, this report has identified several critical guidelines for designing effective AI-enhanced command and control interfaces. Contextual transparency, collaborative decision making, and maintaining human agency emerge as central themes. Applying these guidelines can help ensure that AI augments and empowers human operators, rather than introducing new risks or eroding human decision-making capacity.
