# C2 Interface Design Small Project

## Project Overview

In this small project, you will design a focused interface component for an AI-enhanced command and control (C2) system. The goal is to apply interaction design principles to create an intuitive and effective user experience for a specific C2 task or workflow.

## Learning Objectives

1. Gain hands-on experience designing interfaces for AI-enhanced C2 systems
2. Apply interaction design principles to a specific C2 task or workflow
3. Practice creating wireframes and high-fidelity mockups using Figma
4. Consider accessibility and universal design principles in your interface design

## Project Instructions

1. Choose a focused C2 task or workflow to design an interface for, such as:
    - Asset allocation and tasking
    - Threat detection and prioritization
    - Course of action development and comparison
    - Intelligent alert monitoring and triage
2. Brainstorm key features and interaction patterns for your chosen task, considering how AI capabilities could enhance operator performance and decision making
3. Create low-fidelity wireframes of your interface design using Figma, focusing on layout, information hierarchy, and navigation
4. Develop high-fidelity mockups of key screens or interaction states, incorporating visual design elements and following accessibility best practices
5. Write a short design rationale explaining your key design choices and how they support effective human-AI interaction for your chosen C2 task

## Project Deliverables

- Figma project with:
    - Low-fidelity wireframes of overall interface structure and key screens
    - High-fidelity mockups of key interaction states and design details
    - Clear labeling and organization of design elements and screens
- 4-5 page design rationale document including:
    - Problem statement and design goals for chosen C2 task/workflow
    - Key features and interaction patterns developed
    - Explanation of how AI capabilities are incorporated to enhance operator performance
    - Discussion of accessibility considerations and how they impacted design choices
