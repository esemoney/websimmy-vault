# Case Studies in Designing Interfaces for Delegatory Control of Autonomous Military Systems

Lecture Notes Complete

## Introduction

In this lecture, we'll dive into real-world case studies that demonstrate effective design practices for creating command and control interfaces that enable delegatory control of autonomous military systems. By examining these examples, we'll identify key principles and lessons learned that can inform the development of future AI-enhanced C2 interfaces.

## Case Study 1: DARPA Mosaic Warfare

The DARPA Mosaic Warfare program aims to create a networked system of autonomous assets that can rapidly adapt to changing battlefield conditions. The program's C2 interface enables commanders to set high-level objectives and constraints while delegating execution details to AI agents.

The diagram emphasizes the ability to rapidly reconfigure and adapt the network to changing mission requirements.](https://i0.wp.com/www.thedrive.com/content-b/message-editor%2F1595420561183-mosaic.jpg?resize=1536%2C882&ssl=1)

DARPA's Mosaic Warfare concept enables flexible coordination of autonomous assets.

### Key Design Features

1. High-level goal setting and constraint definition for autonomous agents
2. Real-time visualization of asset status, capabilities, and task assignments
3. Adaptive task allocation based on evolving mission requirements and asset availability
4. Human override capabilities for critical decisions and edge cases

## Case Study 2: Lockheed Martin Multi-Domain Operations Planner

Lockheed Martin's Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) Planner is an AI-assisted C2 system that supports rapid course of action development and dynamic replanning in complex, joint operational environments. The interface enables commanders to collaborate with AI agents in generating and evaluating potential plans.

The interface also includes a panel for AI-assisted course of action development, allowing users to define objectives, constraints, and available resources, and receive optimized plan recommendations from the AI system.](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/photo/army-programs/multi-domain-operations-planner/mdo-ai-planning-tool-2-720.jpg.pc-adaptive.1920.medium.jpg)

Lockheed Martin's MDO Planner enables AI-human collaboration in operational planning.

### Key Design Features

1. Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for rapid course of action development
2. AI-generated suggestions for asset allocation and synchronization
3. Real-time simulation and wargaming to evaluate plan effectiveness
4. Collaborative decision making between human planners and AI agents

## Interactive Prototype: Delegatory C2 Interface Concept

Explore an interactive prototype that demonstrates key design principles for delegatory control interfaces, based on insights from the case studies:

### Prototype Features

1. Goal-based mission definition with adjustable autonomy levels
2. Real-time map view with asset filtering and detail overlays
3. AI-recommended resource allocation and task assignments
4. Streamlined approval flows and human intervention mechanisms

By studying these real-world examples and experimenting with interactive prototypes, designers can develop a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with creating effective interfaces for delegatory control of autonomous military systems. The key is to strike a balance between leveraging AI capabilities and maintaining human oversight and control, while providing intuitive tools for setting goals, monitoring execution, and adapting to evolving situations.
