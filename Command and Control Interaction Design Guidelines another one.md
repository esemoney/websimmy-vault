## Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of interaction design guidelines for AI-enhanced command and control (C2) interfaces. It covers detailed case studies and mini case studies, with a focus on accessibility through detailed alternative text descriptions for all images.

The proliferation of AI technologies is transforming the nature of C2 systems, enabling new capabilities such as intelligent decision support, autonomous asset management, and predictive planning. However, realizing the full potential of these AI-enhanced C2 systems requires careful attention to interaction design, ensuring that interfaces effectively leverage AI while keeping human commanders in control.

Through our analysis of real-world case studies and evolving best practices, we have identified several key principles for designing effective human-AI interactions in C2 contexts. These principles, detailed in the following sections, can inform the development of next-generation C2 interfaces that harness the power of AI in a human-centered manner.

## Detailed Analysis

Our thorough analysis of C2 interface case studies reveals several key interaction design principles:

### 1. Situational Awareness

Interfaces should provide operators with a clear, real-time picture of the operational environment, assets, and threats. AI can enhance situational awareness by fusing data from multiple sources, identifying key patterns and anomalies, and directing attention to salient information.

The map displays friendly force positions in blue, enemy forces in red, and civilian populations in green. The timeline below the map shows planned actions and contingencies. Panels on the right side show intelligence feeds, asset readiness status, and decision support tools.](https://mcoai.dplmi.mit.edu/assets/c2-situational-awareness-ui.png)

The interface in Figure 1 exemplifies several situational awareness-enhancing features, such as real-time asset tracking, differentiation of friendly/hostile/civilian entities, and the integration of intelligence feeds and mission timeline views in a single display.

### 2. Decision Support

AI-powered recommender systems and what-if analysis tools can aid decision making while keeping the human in the loop. Interfaces should present AI-generated insights and action proposals in a transparent and intuitive manner, allowing commanders to quickly understand the rationale and potential impacts.

Each course of action shows projected asset movements and engagement outcomes. Commanders can tweak parameters such as acceptable risk levels and ROE constraints using sliders and dropdowns, causing the AI to generate updated plans. Panels on the left show editable mission objectives and decision points.](https://mcoai.dplmi.mit.edu/assets/c2-decision-support-ui.png)

Figure 2 depicts an AI-enhanced C2 decision support interface that presents commanders with AI-generated courses of action, while still allowing them to adjust parameters and constraints to align with mission objectives and rules of engagement. This human-in-the-loop approach enables commanders to leverage AI support without relinquishing control.

### 3. Collaboration

C2 interfaces need to facilitate seamless collaboration between human operators and AI agents, as well as between distributed human teams. This requires intuitive visualizations of shared situational understanding, AI agent task assignments and rationales, and human team member roles and activities.

An AI agent provides relevant information and action suggestions in response to the ongoing chat. The map view in the center uses colored icons to indicate assets under human vs AI control. Panels on the right show team member status and a task assignment matrix.](https://mcoai.dplmi.mit.edu/assets/c2-collaboration-ui.png)

The interface concept in Figure 3 includes several features to promote effective collaboration, such as an integrated chat interface for human-human and human-AI interaction, clear indications of asset control assignments, and a team status display. By making AI agent activities and human team member roles explicitly visible, this interface aims to foster shared understanding and coordinated action.

### 4. Adaptability

AI-enhanced C2 interfaces should be able to adapt to dynamic mission requirements and operator workload/skill levels. This could involve AI-driven interface reconfiguration, intelligent alerting and information filtering, and dynamic task allocation between human and AI agents based on evolving situational demands.

![Two variations of an adaptive command and control interface. In the first view, suited to a high-intensity situation, the AI has simplified the information presentation to focus only on critical alerts and decision points. The second view, suited to a lower tempo phase, provides more detailed information overlays and enables the operator to customize interface elements and AI support levels using a control panel.](https://mcoai.dplmi.mit.edu/assets/c2-adaptive-ui.png)

Figure 4 illustrates how an AI-powered C2 interface might adapt its information density and control allocation to different operational tempos. In high-intensity situations, the AI streamlines the display to minimize cognitive load and takes on more autonomous tasking. During lower tempo phases, the AI exposes more detailed information and customization options, enabling the operator to fine-tune the interface and AI support to their individual needs and preferences.
