## Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of interaction design guidelines for AI-enhanced command and control (C2) interfaces. It covers detailed case studies, mini case studies, interactive prototypes, and includes alternative text descriptions for all figures to ensure accessibility.

## Detailed Analysis

Our thorough analysis of C2 interface case studies reveals several key interaction design principles:

1. **Situational Awareness:** Interfaces should provide operators with a clear, real-time picture of the operational environment, assets, and threats.
2. **Decision Support:** AI-powered recommender systems and what-if analysis tools can aid decision making while keeping the human in the loop.
3. **Collaboration:** C2 interfaces need to facilitate seamless collaboration between human operators and AI agents, as well as between distributed teams.
4. **Adaptability:** Interfaces should be able to adapt to dynamic mission requirements and operator workload/skill levels.

## Mini Case Studies

- ### Air Defense C2 System
    
    An AI-enhanced air defense C2 system that fuses data from multiple sensors to provide a common operating picture, automatically prioritizes threats, and recommends weapon-target pairings. Allows operators to adjust ROE constraints.
    
- ### Autonomous Resupply Planning Tool
    
    An intelligent planning aid that optimizes resupply missions for forward-deployed units. Considers unit needs, available transport assets, threat levels, and generates optimized delivery schedules. Supports what-if replanning.
    

## Interactive Prototype

Explore our interactive prototype of an AI-enhanced C2 interface for a humanitarian assistance/disaster relief mission:

Key features include a common operating picture with real-time unit tracking, an AI-powered task allocation and scheduling assistant, and collaborative planning tools.
