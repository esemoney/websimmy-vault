# Crash Course: Paper Prototyping for Military AI Interfaces

Paper prototyping may seem old school in an age of slick digital tools, but don't sleep on this lo-fi technique. It can be a UX designer's secret weapon for rapidly iterating on AI-enabled interface concepts, especially in complex domains like defense. Prof. Bowdon breaks it down:

## Why Paper?

Paper is fast. Paper is cheap. Paper is incredibly versatile. When you're trying to wrap your head around workflows for, say, an AI copilot in a next-gen fighter jet - you don't want to get bogged down in Figma too soon. Sketching lets you explore a wide design space quickly, without getting attached to any one concept.

That speed and fluidity is crucial for keeping up with the breakneck pace of AI capabilities. The interaction paradigms for human-machine teaming are evolving in real-time. By working in low-fidelity, we can evolve our designs just as quickly - throwing out 10 bad ideas to get to one good one.

**Pro tip:**Â Use different colors and line weights to distinguish "machine" elements (AI status indicators, recommendations, etc.) from human control elements. It makes the division of labor pop.

## Tactical Storyboarding

Paper prototyping isn't just about sketching interfaces - it's about sketching interactions. And in military scenarios, those interactions are deeply embedded in complex, high-stakes sequences of events. That's where "tactical storyboarding" comes in.

The sketches show a pilot interacting with an AI copilot system at various decision points, such as target identification, weapons release, and evasive maneuvering. Annotations highlight the key information exchanges and control transitions between human and AI.](https://dplmi.mit.edu/course-4.601/professors-detailed-notes-and-crash-course-on-prototyping-with-examples/img/storyboard-example.jpg)

By sketching out key "beats" in a mission or scenario, you can start to pin down where and how AI insights need to surface, where the human needs to be in the loop, and how that handoff happens. These aren't just design decisions - they're operational ones. Paper prototyping lets you think them through at the speed of combat.

## Mocking Up Data

Of course, all the clever AI assistance in the world won't matter if we don't get the information design right. And when you're dealing with adaptive autonomy, that information is dynamic by definition. How do you prototype that? Paper to the rescue again.

Overlaid are small sticky notes and removable tape flags representing dynamic data points and alerts. The modular nature of the paper elements makes it easy to reconfigure the information architecture on the fly.](https://dplmi.mit.edu/course-4.601/professors-detailed-notes-and-crash-course-on-prototyping-with-examples/img/paper-data-mockup.jpg)

By mocking up data with modular paper elements, you can simulate the dynamics of an AI-driven interface - no code required. Sticky notes and dot stickers are your friends!

By using sticky notes, index cards, and removable dot stickers, you can rapidly simulate different data scenarios and see how your layout holds up. Does the priority intel still pop when the algorithm serves up a surprise insight? Does the threat alert drown out the human oversight indicators? These are the kinds of UX snags you want to catch early, before they become capability killers.

## Wizard of AI

Perhaps the most powerful part of paper prototyping for AI is the ability to inject a little human intelligence into the mix. The classic "Wizard of Oz" technique - where a human puppeteer plays the role of the AI behind the scenes - takes on a whole new meaning when you're dealing with battlefield automation.

![Two designers acting out a paper prototype dialogue, simulating a pilot interacting with an AI system. One designer plays the role of the pilot, 'thinking aloud' as they point to interface elements and describe their actions. The other plays the AI, serving up new data points and recommendations on the fly by manipulating sticky notes and paper controls in response to the 'pilot's' cues.](https://dplmi.mit.edu/course-4.601/professors-detailed-notes-and-crash-course-on-prototyping-with-examples/img/wizard-of-oz-setup.jpg)

By having a subject matter expert "play the AI" in response to a test user, you can get a feel for the rhythm and cadence of human-machine collaboration long before you have a fully trained model. Is the AI serving up useful info at the right moments? Is it clear to the user what actions are available, and what's being handled autonomously? Improv meets algo.

## From Paper to Pixels

Of course, paper prototyping is just the start. Eventually you'll need to translate those hard-won insights into higher-fidelity digital forms. But by then, you'll already know you're building on a strong conceptual foundation - one deeply rooted in tactical workflows and user expectations.

More than that, though, paper prototyping trains a certain muscle - a way of thinking fluidly about human-AI interaction under pressure. It's a skill every designer will need in an age of algorithmic warfare. Because in the end, it's not about the medium - it's about the mindset. And sometimes dead trees can teach us more about cutting-edge interaction than all the code in the world.
