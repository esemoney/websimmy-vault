# Crash Course: UI Prototyping for Autonomous Military Systems

Prof. Jane Doe, MIT Department of Artificial Intelligence & Human-Machine Collaboration in Military Systems

Hello students! Based on the great questions that came up in our last class about best practices for prototyping command and control interfaces to manage autonomous systems in the field, I've put together this quick crash course on some key techniques and tools to keep in your toolkit.

## Why Prototype?

Before diving into the how, let's recap the why. Prototyping is an essential step to:

- Externalize your ideas and rapidly test them with users & stakeholders
- Identify usability issues, gaps in understanding, and unstated requirements early before investing heavily in development
- Compare alternative approaches and collectively align on the optimal path forward
- Progressively increase fidelity and dial in the details as confidence grows

This is especially critical in our domain of autonomous military systems given the high stakes and need to build trust and transparency in the human-AI interaction models. We can't afford to get it wrong.

## Prototyping Progression

I recommend following this general progression as you move from concept to living interface:

Adapt prototype fidelity to your learning goals at each stage.

1. **Paper Sketches:** Always start by getting your concepts out of your head and onto paper where others can react to them. Whiteboard wireframes, storyboards, even sticky note flows - all great for quickly iterating at low cost. Focus on the big picture.
2. **Digital Mockups:** Once you've confidence in the overall approach, move into a digital design tool like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD to flesh out the UI in more detail. Import real data & assets as you have them. Start specifying colors, typography, icons, etc.
3. **Interactive Prototype:** Make your mockups clickable to simulate the key interactions and flows. This is where you really start to get a feel for the UX. Tools like InVision, Proto.io, or Framer are great for stitching together screens and adding basic animations.
4. **Functional Front-End:** Once the core UX is validated, it's time to move into your front-end stack of choice and hook the UI up to real or simulated data and services. Leverage a component library to accelerate development. Get it in front of users ASAP and iterate, iterate, iterate!

## Military AI-Specific Considerations

A few special considerations when prototyping command UIs for autonomous military systems:

- Ensure your prototypes cover both the "happy path" of nominal autonomous operations and the "unhappy paths" of system failures, low-confidence decisions, and human intervention scenarios. Edge cases matter.
- Simulate realistic, noisy data from multiple sensors and subsystems. Check that your UI handles data gaps and conflicting inputs gracefully. Synthesize plausible anomalies.
- Test your concepts under cognitive stress and time pressure. Evaluate how well the UI supports rapid situation assessment and decision making. Optimize for glanceability.
- Pay extra attention to explainability and "why" interactions that build operator trust and traceability of system behaviors. Make AI reasoning transparent.
- Engage SMEs like mission commanders to roleplay realistic operational scenarios and validate your mission planning and C2 interactions. Immerse yourself in the user's world.

Take your prototypes out into the field early and often to test under real-world conditions.

## Learn by Doing

To close, the most important advice I can give is to make prototyping a core part of your practice as an autonomous systems interface designer. The more you prototype, the better you'll get at identifying what to prototype when, how much fidelity is needed to answer the questions at hand, and what tools to use.

Cultivate a curious mindset, construct prototypes to learn, and embrace iteration based on user feedback. Know that the interfaces you craft will directly shape how effectively our armed forces can wield technological superiority while keeping humans meaningfully in the loop. It's a huge responsibility and an exciting design space rife with potential for innovation. I can't wait to see the prototypes you come up with in class!
