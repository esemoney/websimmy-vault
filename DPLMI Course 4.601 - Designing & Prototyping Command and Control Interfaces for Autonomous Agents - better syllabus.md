# DPLMI Course 4.601 - Designing & Prototyping Command and Control Interfaces for Autonomous Agents

## Course Syllabus - Fall 2025

4.601 is an advanced project-based course covering the theory and practice of designing command and control (C2) interfaces for military autonomous systems. Students will learn to create interfaces that enable effective human-AI collaboration in complex, high-stakes operational environments. The course emphasizes a human-centered design approach, with a focus on prototyping and evaluating C2 interfaces through interactive simulations.

### Course Objectives

Through this course, students will develop:

- An understanding of the unique challenges and design considerations for C2 interfaces overseeing autonomous systems in military contexts
- Familiarity with key design patterns, visualizations, and interaction paradigms for effective human-AI collaboration in high-stakes domains
- Skills in prototyping C2 interfaces at varying fidelities using industry-standard tools like Figma and the Unity game engine
- Experience with planning and conducting user evaluations of C2 interface prototypes through interactive simulations
- Ability to analyze real-world case studies to extract insights and synthesize design guidelines for AI-enhanced C2 systems
- Appreciation for the legal, ethical, and societal implications of increasingly autonomous military technologies and the critical role of mindful interface design

### Measurable Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Describe the key human factors, design challenges, and failure modes specific to C2 interfaces for autonomous military systems (Assessed through weekly reading reflections & quizzes)
2. Decompose a C2 interface design problem, generate potential solutions, and rationalize design choices (Assessed through problem sets & design project milestones)
3. Translate a C2 interface design into an interactive prototype using industry tools and techniques (Assessed through problem sets & design project)
4. Plan and conduct a user evaluation study of a C2 interface prototype to assess usability, identify issues, and recommend improvements (Assessed through final group project)
5. Critique real C2 interface designs in terms of Nielsen's heuristics and domain-specific design guidelines (Assessed through case study assignments)
6. Articulate the broader implications, open questions, and future directions for human-centered design of autonomous military systems (Assessed through individual reflective essay)

### Textbooks & Readings

This course will draw from two required textbooks:

- Largent, F. (2022). _Designing Trustworthy AI: A Human-Centered Approach to Reliable, Safe, and Transparent Autonomous Systems_. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.
- Miller, C. A. (Ed.). (2021). _Human-Autonomy Teaming: Theories, Methods, and Design Guidelines_. New York: CRC Press.

Links to additional required readings will be provided through the course website. The readings under each week should be completed prior to that week's first lecture. Come prepared to discuss and ask questions.
