# DPLMI Course 4.601 - Designing & Prototyping Command and Control Interfaces for Autonomous Agents

## Complete Course Syllabus - Fall 2025

4.601 is an advanced course covering the theory and practice of designing command and control interfaces for military autonomous systems. Students will learn to create interfaces that enable effective human-AI collaboration in complex, high-stakes operational environments.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Design intuitive C2 interfaces that enhance human-AI teaming in supervisory control contexts
- Select appropriate interface technologies (e.g. AR/VR, conversational AI, mobile, etc.) for different C2 use cases
- Prototype C2 interface designs at various levels of fidelity using Figma, HTML/CSS/JS and Unity
- Evaluate C2 interface usability through heuristic evaluation, user studies and quantitative metrics
- Understand the regulatory and ethical landscape governing the design of C2 interfaces for autonomous weapons

### Group Design Project

A central focus of 4.601 is the capstone group design project. In teams of 3-4, you will design and prototype a C2 interface for enabling human supervision of autonomous agents in a military mission context. Potential project prompts include:

- A virtual reality C2 interface for commanding a swarm of autonomous drones conducting reconnaissance
- A conversational AI interface for tasking and monitoring autonomous ground vehicles in an urban patrol mission
- An augmented reality heads-up display for manned-unmanned teaming between a fighter pilot and loyal wingman drones
- A multi-modal C2 interface integrating EEG input and gaze tracking for supervisory control of autonomous undersea vehicles

Projects will be scoped in collaboration with the teaching staff and industry/government partners to address real-world needs. [Click here](https://mcoai.dplmi.mit.edu/course-4.601/projects) for detailed project requirements, milestones, and judging criteria.
