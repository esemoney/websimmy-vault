## Project Overview

This case study walks through the end-to-end process of designing, prototyping, and evaluating a command and control (C2) interface for operating a swarm of autonomous drones in an urban reconnaissance mission context. The goal is to explore novel human-swarm interaction paradigms that enable a single operator to effectively supervise and dynamically re-task a large number of semi-autonomous drones.

## Design Process

The design process followed these key steps:

1. **Needfinding:** Conducted interviews with drone operators and field commanders to understand mission requirements, current pain points, and desired capabilities.
2. **Ideation:** Brainstormed a range of interaction concepts for intuitive swarm control, information visualization, and anomaly response. Key ideas included gestural & voice commands, AR overlays, and predictive alerts.
3. **Lo-fi Prototyping:** Created storyboards and paper prototypes of selected concepts to quickly communicate and iterate on the interaction flows.
4. **Hi-fi Prototyping:** Developed an interactive prototype in Unity integrating real-time 3D visualizations, dynamic map overlays, and simulated swarm behaviors & sensor feeds.
5. **User Evaluation:** Conducted scenario-based usability tests with operators, gathering qual & quant feedback on the UI's learnability, efficiency, and robustness.

## Key Design Decisions

Some of the key design decisions made based on user needs and feedback:

- **Hybrid control model:** Allow operator to flexibly shift between high-level goal & constraint specification and fine-grained drone tasking as needed. Aims to balance autonomy & control.
- **Progressive disclosure:** Provide a top-level mission status overview by default, with ability to drill down into individual drone feeds & controls on-demand. Manages complexity.
- **Predictive alerts:** Use AI to surface and draw attention to potential anomalies or surprises in the drone sensor feeds before they become critical. Supports proactive supervision.
- **AR + Voice interface:** Enables heads-up, hands-free interaction with the swarm visualizations and controls through an AR headset. Frees up operator's physical and cognitive resources.

> "The ability to throw a lasso around a group of drones on the 3D map and give them all a new high-level directive with one voice command is a game-changer. So much more efficient than the old way of managing them all individually." - User Study Participant

## Evaluation Results

The prototype performed well in the user evaluations, with key results including:

|Metric|Result|
|---|---|
|Mission completion rate|93%|
|Avg. targets detected per mission|37|
|Avg. time to re-task swarm|15 sec|
|SUS Usability Score|88/100|

The combination of high productivity metrics and subjective usability scores indicate the interface succeeds in enabling efficient swarm C2. The gestural and voice command interactions were particularly well-received. The main area for improvement is providing more nuanced control over the autonomy when needed in time-critical situations.

## Future Work

Potential future enhancements include:

- Integrating a conversational AI agent to enable more natural language dialog with the swarm
- Auto-generating optimal swarm tactics & formations based on mission parameters
- Visualizing predicted swarm actions & effects to improve operator's situational awareness
- Adding a "swarm replay" function to support after-action review & training

Overall, this case study demonstrates the potential for _mixed-initiative human-swarm teaming_ interfaces that leverage the scale and autonomy of robotic collectives while preserving meaningful human judgment and control in military operations.

The future of human-swarm interaction is taking flight.
