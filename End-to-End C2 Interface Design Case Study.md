# End-to-End C2 Interface Design Case Study

## Asteroid Mining Swarm Command & Control

What follows is an exemplary end-to-end case study completed by a student team in the 4.601 C2 Interface Design course. It showcases the key phases and deliverables of the human-centered design process tailored for an imagined swarm space mining application.

### 1. Concept & Needfinding

The team began by researching the emerging domain of autonomous asteroid mining, interviewing domain experts, and studying analogous systems to identify key challenges and opportunities for human-swarm teaming.

> "The extreme distances, communication lags, and alien operating environment necessitate a radical rethinking of the human role. We need to enable 'management by intent' - empowering human operators to flexibly express high-level goals that guide swarm self-organization."

### 2. Task Analysis & Modeling

Next they decomposed the envisioned asteroid mining mission into key tasks and subtasks, modeling the workload, information flows, and interdependencies. This helped reveal critical junctures for human input and oversight.

Asteroid Mining Tasklist (excerpt)
- Scan & select target asteroids  
  - Deploy wide area sensor network
  - Analyze spectral signatures
  - Estimate resource concentrations
- Assign swarm elements to asteroids
  - Optimize based on swarm state & estimated yields  
  - Adapt & reallocate as new data comes in
- Coordinate extraction & processing
  - Guide drilling microbots 
  - Route extracted material to processing craft
  - Monitor & adjust processing parameters

### 3. Ideation & Lo-Fi Prototyping

With these insights, the team rapidly generated a diverse set of ideas for the core C2 interface, exploring different mental models, interaction paradigms, and visual representations. Lightweight sketches and storyboards allowed quick iteration and stakeholder feedback.

### 4. Hi-Fi Prototyping & Simulation

The most promising concepts were then developed into interactive hi-fidelity prototypes using Figma and Unity3D. Key interactions for specifying swarm intent, visualizing progress and anomalies, and guiding swarm actions were simulated in mission-relevant scenarios.

### 5. Evaluation & Iteration

The team conducted a series of user evaluations with their functional prototypes, gathering both quantitative performance data and qualitative feedback on operator experience. Insights were translated into targeted design refinements in the next iteration.

> "Transitioning from 2D map views to immersive 3D visualizations that let you fly through the asteroid field was a game changer for maintaining situational awareness without overwhelming the operator." - Subject #3

### 6. Reflection & Future Work

Finally, the team synthesized the key lessons learned and outlined directions for future work, emphasizing the need for explainable AI to help calibrate operator trust and richer mechanisms for expressing commander's intent to increasingly autonomous systems.

> "This project really drove home both the immense potential and the immense challenges in human-swarm collaboration contexts. While we made exciting progress, we've only scratched the surface in terms of the AI and interaction breakthroughs needed to unlock the full potential of human-swarm teaming in complex space operations."

This thoughtful reflection and clear articulation of forward-looking research questions is a hallmark of strong work in this course, demonstrating not only hands-on design skills but conceptual thinking around this multifaceted domain.

I hope this example case study provides a helpful template and some inspiration as you embark on your own design explorations this semester! Remember, the journey of thoroughly exploring the problem space and iteratively prototyping and testing solutions is just as important as the final designs. Dive in and enjoy the process!
