# Figma Prototyping Case Study: Designing Interfaces for Human-Autonomous Agent Teaming

This case study demonstrates how the interface design tool Figma can be used to rapidly prototype complex human-AI interactions, such as those needed for commanding autonomous military agents. We walk through the process of iteratively designing and testing a concept interface for an aerial drone swarm commander.

## Project Overview

The goal was to design a tablet-based interface that allows a field operator to specify mission parameters, monitor real-time drone status and sensor feeds, and maintain meaningful human control over a squadron of semi-autonomous drones. Key user flows included:

- Mission planning and asset allocation
- Real-time mission monitoring and intervention
- Autonomous agent behavior explanation and adjustment
- Sensor data fusion and analysis

## Design Process

1. **Research and requirements gathering** - Interviewed subject matter experts to understand operational needs, constraints, and mental models.
2. **Concept sketching** - Rapidly generated multiple interface layout ideas to explore the design space.
3. **Wireframing** - Created grayscale wireframes in Figma to define content hierarchy and key interactions.
4. **Visual design** - Applied a visual style guide to wireframes, ensuring legibility and consistency.
5. **Interaction prototyping** - Linked screens together in Figma to simulate core user flows and gather feedback.

A key insight that emerged was the importance of a map-centric display for maintaining geospatial situational awareness. This became a central organizing element of the interface.

## Figma Prototyping Techniques

Figma's collaborative features enabled rapid design iteration by allowing the entire team to view and comment on the latest screens. Some of the powerful prototyping capabilities we leveraged were:

- **Component libraries** - Reusable UI elements sped up screen design and maintained consistency
- **Auto-layout** - Buttons and forms that automatically resize enabled quick layout experimentation
- **Interactive overlays** - Hover effects and click-triggered layers added rich interactivity
- **Device frames** - Previewing the design in tablet dimensions revealed usability issues early

## Lessons Learned

Prototyping the human-autonomous agent interface in Figma surfaced several important design challenges:

- Choosing the right level of abstraction for Al explanations
- Designing failsafe mechanisms for human intervention
- Managing display complexity as drone swarm size scales up
- Communicating intent between human and AI agents

Creating prototypes early and often accelerated the discovery of these issues and allowed rapidly testing potential solutions with operators. The fidelity of the Figma prototype enabled collecting actionable feedback and identifying areas for refinement.

Overall, the project demonstrated the power of Figma as a prototyping tool for cutting-edge human-AI interaction design, through its ability to quickly build realistic simulations of non-existent interfaces. The resulting prototype served as an effective boundary object between designers, engineers, and end users to align expectations and drive development of a robust real-world system.
