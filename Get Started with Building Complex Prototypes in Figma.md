# Get Started with Building Complex Prototypes in Figma

Welcome to this hands-on tutorial on building sophisticated prototypes in Figma to model human interactions with autonomous agents and AI systems.

Figma is a powerful collaborative interface design tool that allows you to rapidly mock up high-fidelity user experiences. Its prototyping features enable simulating multi-step flows, conditional logic, and rich interactions - perfect for exploring AI-driven interfaces and autonomous system behavior.

In this tutorial, we'll walk through key techniques to create immersive prototypes that feel like the real thing, including:

- Organizing your prototype structure with frames and layers
- Designing adaptive layouts with constraints, auto-layout and components
- Simulating various AI system states and outputs
- Enabling user input and interaction
- Defining conditional flows and animations
- Integrating real data and logic

By the end, you'll have a solid foundation to design rich human-AI interactions in Figma. Let's dive in!

## Step 1: Structure Your Prototype 🏗️

The first step is to lay out the overall structure and user flow of your prototype. In Figma, you'll do this with Frames - the building blocks of your designs.

Create a Frame for each major screen or state in your user flow. For example, a basic prototype might have Frames for:

- The initial system state/home screen
- Key input screens and forms
- Confirmations and results
- Error or edge case handling

![Example Figma prototype structure](https://i.imgur.com/M2LwlBE.png)
> *This example shows a Figma canvas with several frames laid out to represent the main screens and states of a prototype user flow. Starting in the top left is a larger frame representing the initial home screen or system state. Arrows point from this to smaller frames on the right capturing key input screens, forms, and data entry points in the user journey. Below these are frames illustrating confirmations, results, or success states after the user completes a process. In the bottom right are a few frames showing error messages or edge case handling screens. The overall layout creates a clear visualization of the primary flow and architecture of the prototype, with annotations and arrows further clarifying the relationships and transitions between each frame and state.*

Organize your Frames on the canvas to visualize the flow. Use arrows and annotations to map out the connections and conditions that link Frames together.

Aim to capture the key moments and paths in the user journey - don't worry about every possible micro-interaction at this stage. The goal is to build a skeleton you can flesh out as you go.

## Step 2: Design Adaptive Layouts 🖼️

Next, you'll design the actual UI of each frame, leveraging Figma's powerful layout and component features.

Start by defining a responsive grid and applying consistent styles (colors, fonts, spacing) to ensure your design scales gracefully across device sizes. Figma's Constraints and Auto-Layout make it easy to build fluid, flexible frames.

![Figma constraints and auto-layout](https://i.imgur.com/ugnXUGv.png)

> *This image demonstrates Figma's Constraints and Auto-Layout features for creating responsive designs. On the left is a simple card component with an icon, title, and description. The Constraints panel is open, showing options to set horizontal and vertical constraints to control how the card resizes and pins to its parent frame. On the right, multiple instances of the card are shown inside an Auto-Layout frame. The layout properties are visible, set to Vertical direction with 24px padding and 16px spacing between items. Resizing the frame causes the cards to responsively stack and stretch to fill the available space while maintaining their internal padding and spacing. This illustrates how Constraints define responsive resizing behavior for individual elements, while Auto-Layout allows quick creation of flexible, direction-agnostic container frames to build up complex, adaptive interfaces.*

As you design each element, consider how it may need to adapt based on different data inputs or AI system states. Figma Components are reusable UI modules that can have multiple Variants - perfect for modeling dynamic, data-driven interfaces.

For example, you might create a Component for displaying AI-generated recommendations, with Variants for different confidence levels, categories, or user preferences.

![Example Figma component variants](https://i.imgur.com/rkw9GKO.png)

> *This screenshot shows a "Recommended Item" Figma Component with multiple Variants representing different possible AI-generated suggestion states. The base Component is a card with a placeholder image, title, description, and "Add" button. In the Variants section, there are several options derived from this base: 1. "Highly Rated" Variant - The card background is green, the title says "Top Pick", and there are 5 filled star icons indicating a high rating or confidence score. 2. "Frequently Bought" Variant - The card has a blue background, the title changes to "Popular", and there is an icon showing a shopping cart with an up arrow to represent high purchase frequency. 3. "Personal Favorite" Variant - This card has a purple background, the title reads "Recommended for You", and there is a heart icon suggesting it matches the user's preferences. 4. "Uncertain" Variant - The card turns grey, the image is replaced with a question mark, and the title changes to "Still Learning". This represents a suggestion the AI is not very confident about. By creating these Variants, the designer can showcase different recommendation types the AI may generate within a single cohesive Component, which can then be easily placed and toggled throughout the prototype to simulate a range of personalized, data-driven interface states.*

Figma's Component properties also allow you to expose key parameters for customization - like text, images, or even custom data attributes. This becomes very handy for adding real content and logic down the line.

## Step 3: Simulate AI System States 🤖

A key aspect of prototyping human-AI interactions is modeling the various states and outputs the AI system can produce, and how those are communicated to the user.

In your designs, consider the key inflection points where the AI provides input or takes action. For each of these, create frames representing the range of possible paths, such as:

- Successful AI action with high confidence
- Successful action but with low confidence or caveats
- Failure modes - when the AI is uncertain or unable to proceed
- Fallback states and graceful degradation

![Simulating AI system states in Figma](https://i.imgur.com/SvGvJb6.png)

> *This image depicts a set of Figma frames illustrating various AI system states in the context of an autonomous vehicle interface. The first frame shows a "Normal Driving" state, with the AI displaying a high confidence level, the current speed limit, and the upcoming route or turn. Everything has a calm blue tone indicating smooth operation. The next frame shows an "Obstruction Detected" state. Here the AI has identified an obstacle on the road ahead, which is highlighted in an orange box. The confidence meter has dropped slightly and an "Analyzing" message suggests the AI is working to determine the best path forward. The color palette incorporates more cautionary yellows and oranges. The third frame represents an "Unidentified Object" state. A blurry shape is highlighted in red with a warning icon, and the AI confidence has dropped significantly. A prominent "Take Control" alert indicates the car is not able to safely proceed and is requesting manual intervention from the human driver. The overall UI has shifted to more urgent reds and a low-contrast "emergency mode". The final frame shows a "System Inactive" state, where the AI is essentially offline. All the smart features are greyed out, a diagnostic error code is displayed, and a "Manual Only" message shows the human has full control. The simplified UI and desaturated palette reinforce the powered-down status. By visually simulating this spectrum of AI states, from confident operation to graceful failure and handoff, the designer can explore how the system might communicate its shifting capabilities and needs to the user to maintain situational awareness and control as conditions change.*

Use Figma's prototyping tools to animate between states and simulate the AI system's behavior over time. This could include status messages, loading states, or visualizations of the AI's "thought process".

The goal is to think through the different scenarios the AI may encounter and design the appropriate human interaction flows for each path.

## Step 4: Enable User Input and Interaction ✍️

Of course, the user also needs to be able to interact with the AI system. Figma's prototyping features allow you to simulate user input and define how the interface responds.

Add prototype interactions to your frames for key user actions like clicking buttons, selecting options, typing text, or providing voice input. You can define these interactions to navigate between frames, trigger animations, or update Component properties.

![Figma prototyping interaction panel](https://i.imgur.com/yVNouXC.png)

> *This screenshot displays the Figma Prototype panel, focused on defining user interactions and flow between frames. The selected frame contains a simple form with First Name, Last Name, and Email text input fields, along with a prominent "Create Account" button at the bottom. In the Interactions section of the properties panel, the "Create Account" button is selected as the trigger element. The Interaction Type is set to "On Click (Tap)", meaning this action will occur when the user clicks or taps the button. The Destination is set to "Frame 2", with an Interaction "Smart Animate" and an Easing of "Ease Out". This means that when the button is clicked, Figma will automatically animate and transition the user to the designated "Frame 2", likely a confirmation or welcome screen in this account creation user flow. Additional options allow setting a custom Transition, Duration, and Overlay position for the navigation between frames. By configuring interactions this way, the designer can setup clickable elements and define the relationships and transitions between interface states, allowing them to simulate realistic user input and navigation flows directly within Figma's interactive Prototype mode.*

Consider the various ways the user and AI may need to exchange information at each step. Figma supports a variety of interaction types, including:

- Tap/click
- Drag
- Scroll and pan
- Hover
- Keyboard input
- Voice

Use these interactions to allow the user to provide input, confirm or reject AI suggestions, ask for more info, or take control when needed.

Aim to strike a balance between giving the user agency and leveraging the AI's capabilities. Too many prompts can be tedious, while too few may leave the user feeling out of the loop.

## Step 5: Define Conditional Flows and Animations 🌿

Robust human-AI interactions often involve complex, branching flows based on conditions like user input, AI confidence, or external factors. Figma's conditional interactions and animations help bring these flows to life.

In the prototyping panel, you can set up interactions that only trigger if certain conditions are met. For example, you might have a confirmation button that becomes active only after the user has made a selection:

![Figma conditional interaction](https://i.imgur.com/bFnNMMu.png)

> *This image shows an example of setting up a conditional interaction in Figma's prototyping panel. The frame contains a simple item selection interface, with a list of color options on the left and an "Add to Cart" button on the right. In the interaction properties for the "Add to Cart" button, the Interaction Type is set to "On Click (Tap)". However, under the Conditions section, a rule is defined: "Interaction only plays if Color is Equal to $colorSelection". This means that the "Add to Cart" button will only be clickable and trigger the designated navigation flow if the user has actually selected a color option from the provided list. Until a color is clicked, the button remains inactive, preventing users from proceeding without completing the required input. By setting up conditional interactions this way, designers can create smarter, more dynamic prototypes that adapt based on user input, selections, or other defined variables and logic. This is especially powerful for simulating AI-driven interfaces that may have different outputs or recommendations based on the specific user context and behaviors at each step of the flow.*

You can also define multi-step animations and transitions between frames based on conditions. This allows you to model sophisticated AI behaviors and guide the user's attention.

For example, you might animate a series of AI-generated options appearing one after another, with a pulse effect calling out the top recommendation.

![Figma multi-step animation](https://i.imgur.com/HcUBkeL.png)

> *This series of Figma frames demonstrates a multi-step conditional flow and animation for an AI-powered product recommendation interface. The first frame shows a simple product grid with a "Show Recommendations" button below it. The user clicks this button to initiate the AI suggestion flow. In the next frame, the product grid fades into the background and three new product cards animate in from the right side of the screen, staggering in one at a time with a slight delay between each. These cards represent the AI-generated recommendations based on the user's behavior and preferences. As the third recommended product card slides into place, it expands slightly larger than the others and a subtle pulsing animation highlights it. A tooltip appears above it that reads "Top Pick for You!". This indicates that the AI has determined this particular item to be the most relevant recommendation for the user. The user can then click on any of these recommended product cards to navigate to a detail page and potentially add the item to their cart. By choreographing this kind of sequential animation and highlighting the top AI suggestion differently, the designer guides the user's focus through the recommendation flow and provides clear visual hierarchy and emphasis on the most relevant result. The additional "Top Pick" copy and pulsing effect reinforce the AI's personalized decision and create a more engaging, dynamic interface for presenting curated choices to the user.*


Think through the key decision points and branches in your user flow and use conditions and animations to illustrate how they unfold over time.

## Step 6: Integrate Real Data and Logic 📊

To make your prototype feel truly life-like, you'll want to integrate realistic data and content. Figma integrates with various data sources and plugins to bring your designs to life.

Figma's API allows you to pipe in data from external sources like spreadsheets, databases, or even live AI models. You can map this data to Component properties to dynamically populate your designs.

![Figma API data integration](https://i.imgur.com/6OBSIEa.png)



There are also many Figma plugins that generate realistic placeholder content - from user profile photos and names to product info and metrics. Leveraging these can add a level of realism to your prototypes that static placeholders can't match.

On top of data, you can also model basic logic and data manipulation within Figma. The new Widget feature allows building custom interactive elements powered by JavaScript code. This opens up possibilities like form validation, data visualization, or even mini AI-driven simulations right within your prototype.

The more "real" feeling you can make your prototype, the more useful insights you'll gain about the human-AI interaction flows when testing with users.
