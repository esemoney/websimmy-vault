# Guidelines for Designing Effective Human-AI Command Interfaces

## DPLMI Course 4.601 - Designing & Prototyping Command and Control Interfaces for Autonomous Agents

### Introduction

Based on the analysis of real-world case studies and a synthesis of best practices from the fields of human-computer interaction, AI, and military command & control, the DPLMI 4.601 instructional team has compiled the following guidelines for designing effective human-AI command interfaces. These guidelines aim to promote the creation of C2 systems that leverage the strengths of both human and machine intelligence while mitigating the risks and limitations of each.

While these guidelines provide a solid foundation, designers must also consider the unique operational context, user needs, and technical constraints of each specific application. Interface design for human-AI collaboration in high-stakes military settings remains an active area of research with many open challenges and opportunities for innovation.

### Design Guidelines

1. Design for Appropriate Levels of Automation & Delegation
    
    Effective C2 interfaces strike a balance between human agency and machine autonomy. Designers should carefully consider which decisions and actions to allocate to the AI vs. the human operator based on factors such as:
    
    - The complexity and time constraints of the task
    - The reliability and explainability of the AI's performance
    - The criticality and irreversibility of the outcomes
    - Legal and ethical constraints around the use of force
    
    Interfaces should support dynamic, granular control over the level of automation as situational demands change:
    
    > "A 'sliding scale' of automation that allows operators to flexibly delegate and revoke tasks to the AI based on their confidence, workload, and the stakes involved is ideal."
    
2. Communicate Intent & Objectives, Not Just Commands
    
    Rather than relying solely on direct, low-level commands, C2 interfaces should enable operators to express their higher-level intent, goals, and constraints to the AI. This intent-based interaction paradigm allows the AI to reason about objectives, adapt to changing circumstances, and act with greater autonomy within the boundaries set by the human.
    
    > "An effective autonomous wingman shouldn't need micromanagement â€“ the pilot should be able to say 'Cover my six and conserve fuel' and trust the AI to translate that intent into action."
    
    Designers must develop intuitive methods for capturing and conveying human intent to AI agents, whether through natural language, visual annotations, cross-modality representations, or novel interaction techniques.
    
3. Provide Situational Awareness Without Overload
    
4. Support Calibrated Trust Through Transparency & Predictability
    
    Cultivating an appropriate level of operator trust in the AI is critical for effective human-machine teaming. Transparency about the AI's capabilities, limitations, and decision making can help calibrate trust, as can designs that make the AI's behaviors more predictable and easy to interpret.
    
    > "If the human can't understand why the AI does what it does, they will either over-trust and become complacent or under-trust and constantly second-guess it. Neither is optimal."
    
    C2 interfaces should incorporate explainable AI techniques, AI self-awareness displays, and algorithm visualization to open up the "black box." Post-hoc mission replay and analysis tools are also valuable for identifying lessons learned and building long-term trust.
    
5. Provide Mechanisms for Intervention & Oversight
    
    Even highly autonomous systems require a human-in-the-loop for handling unexpected situations, overriding errors, and ensuring adherence to commander's intent. C2 interfaces should make it easy for operators to intervene, redirect, and terminate autonomous actions when necessary.
    
    > "When algorithms start making life-or-death decisions in war, having a big red button to slam on the brakes is an absolute must."
    
    Designers should provide clear affordances for interrupting and modifying AI tasks, while ensuring the operator has sufficient information to make those interventions judiciously. Features for setting "tripwires," pre-specifying constraints, and accepting AI-generated recommendations can enable proactive human oversight.
    

### Conclusion

Designing command interfaces for human-AI collaboration in military settings poses both immense challenges and opportunities. By centering human control, leveraging the complementary strengths of people and AI, and rigorously field testing solutions, we can craft systems that transform the future of command and control for the better.

However, technology design is only one part of the equation. Maximizing the potential of human-AI teaming also requires rigorous selection and training of operators, redesign of organizational concepts, and serious consideration of the legal, ethical, and societal implications of increased machine autonomy in warfare. While much work remains, these guidelines serve as an important step towards a future of effective human-machine collaboration in defense of freedom.

We encourage C2 interface designers to put these guidelines into practice, test them against real-world cases, and share their findings with the DPLMI research community. Only together can we build the knowledge and tools to support the warfighters of today and tomorrow.
