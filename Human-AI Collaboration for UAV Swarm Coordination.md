# Human-AI Collaboration for UAV Swarm Coordination

4.601 - Designing and Prototyping Military Interfaces with Autonomous Agents  
Case Study Brief

## Operational Context

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are becoming an increasingly important asset in military operations, enabling distributed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), as well as coordinated strikes. However, the complexity of controlling and coordinating large numbers of semi-autonomous drones presents significant human-machine interaction challenges.

Operators need to be able to specify swarm-level behaviors, allocate tasks to subgroups, and flexibly intervene in individual UAV actions when needed. Conversely, the swarm as a whole must intelligently adapt to dynamic mission parameters and provide the human with vital situation awareness without cognitive overload. Effective collaboration requires a delicate balance of human supervisory control and swarm autonomy.

## Design Challenge

Your team's challenge is to prototype an advanced human-swarm interface that leverages AI to enable fluid coordination between a single operator and a UAV swarm in executing an ISR mission. The interface should support key tasks such as:

- Specifying swarm formation, dispersion patterns and navigation waypoints
- Tasking of sub-swarms for distributed sensing or focused inspection
- Visualizing swarm status and collected intelligence (imagery, signals data, etc.)
- Alerting to anomalies, attrition or disruption of swarm integrity
- Drill-down control of individual UAVs when needed

The goal is to provide intuitive, high-level tasking while leveraging AI-powered swarm autonomy to handle low-level coordination and optimize for mission objectives. Thoughtful visualizations, smart alerts, and seamless transitions between levels of control will be key.

Consider how an AI agent could assist the operator not just in coordinating the swarm, but also in making sense of collected data and recommending courses of action. How might an intelligent UI adapt to the operator's cognitive state and dynamically adjust its level of automation or information presentation? Push beyond conventional ground control station paradigms to envision a more collaborative human-AI approach to managing swarm operations.

Feel free to incorporate promising interaction paradigms from related domains like air traffic control, fleet logistics, or real-time strategy games.

The teaching staff will support your prototyping process and can provide access to UAV simulation sandboxes for testing and demonstration of your swarm interface concepts.
