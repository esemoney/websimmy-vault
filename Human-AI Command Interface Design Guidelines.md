# Human-AI Command Interface Design Guidelines

## Interactive Tutorial with Mini-Case Studies

### Introduction

Welcome to the interactive tutorial on designing effective human-AI command and control interfaces! In this tutorial, we'll take a hands-on approach to exploring key design guidelines synthesized from real-world case studies and best practices. You'll have the chance to see the guidelines in action through interactive prototypes and mini-case studies that illustrate core concepts.

As you go through each guideline, think about how you might apply these principles in your own C2 interface designs for AI-enabled military systems. Consider the unique challenges and opportunities of the specific operational context you are designing for. The key is to create interfaces that harness the power of AI while ensuring meaningful human control and situational understanding.

### Interactive Design Guidelines

1

Calibrate Automation to Context

Effective interfaces enable dynamic delegation of tasks to the AI based on the complexity, time pressure, risk level, and human workload of the situation. Explore this concept in a mini-case study on an adaptive AI tasking system for a UAV ground control station:

UAV Flexible Autonomy Manager

The UAV control interface features an "Autonomy Dial" that allows the operator to quickly adjust the AI's level of control based on the phase of flight and anticipated challenges. During complex urban operations, the operator keeps the autonomy level lower to maintain closer oversight. But when the UAV is in transit over empty terrain, they can dial up autonomy to reduce monitoring workload and focus on mission planning.

Express Intent, Not Just Commands

Enable operators to communicate higher-level goals, priorities and constraints to the AI rather than micromanaging every action. The AI can then reason about how best to achieve the human's intent within specified boundaries. See an example of an intent-based interface for controlling an autonomous ground vehicle:

3

Provide Focused Situational Awareness

Keep the human in the loop with clear, timely updates on autonomous agent status and actions without overwhelming them with raw data. This example shows an event-based notification system in an underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV) control interface:

Make AI Behaviors Transparent & Predictable

Help cultivate appropriate operator trust by providing visibility into the AI's capabilities, limitations, and decision rationale. Users should be able to anticipate how the AI will behave in different situations. This mini-case looks at predictability mechanisms in a missile defense C2 interface:

Enable Seamless Human Intervention

Humans must be able to quickly and easily redirect or halt AI actions that threaten mission success or violate rules of engagement. Careful interface design can ensure human operators remain in control while minimizing friction. Here's an intervention scenario using a directed energy weapon (DEW) system:

### Putting It All Together

The key to applying these guidelines effectively is tailoring them thoughtfully to your specific use case and military context. There is no universal one-size-fits-all solution. By putting the human at the center of your design process, analyzing real-world workflow and decision making, and rapidly prototyping and testing concepts, you can create C2 interfaces that empower operators and AI to collaboratively achieve mission objectives.

Designing the next generation of human-AI command interfaces is a complex, multidisciplinary challenge at the intersection of HCI, AI, human factors, and military innovation. It requires grappling with not only tough interaction design problems but also the legal, ethical, and societal implications of increased machine autonomy in warfare.

To dive deeper into this critical domain, explore the additional case study reports and academic papers in the [MCOAI resource library](https://mcoai.dplmi.mit.edu/course-4.601/case-studies-detailed-analysis-reports/). You can also share your own case studies, prototypes, and lessons learned with the broader military AI community of interest to advance the state of the art. Together, we can design the human-AI teaming approaches needed to maintain strategic and operational advantage on the battlefields of the future.
