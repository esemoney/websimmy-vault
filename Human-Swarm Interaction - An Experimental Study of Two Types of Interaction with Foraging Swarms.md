## ABSTRACT

This study investigates two fundamental types of human-swarm interaction for controlling robotic swarms: human influence via selected leaders, and human influence via environmental features known as beacons. Both approaches are compared to each other and to a baseline condition without human influence. The effectiveness of each approach and its differential impact on human workload are explored through an experimental study which varies both mode of interaction and swarm size. Results indicate that swarm behavior influences human workload and that the effectiveness of an interaction mode is largely dependent on swarm size. Both interaction modes had less maneuver time than the baseline condition and the beacon mode had lower deviation from an ideal path than leader mode.

## INTRODUCTION

Robotic swarms are large groups of simple robots that coordinate autonomously via local interactions to achieve some goal. Human-swarm interaction (HSI) is the study of how humans can influence these swarms to achieve specified goals. This paper explores two fundamental HSI approaches: leaders and beacons.

In leader-based HSI, the human influences one or a few swarm members (leaders) which then coordinate the remaining swarm. In beacon-based HSI, the human places beacons in the environment which guide or attract the swarm. We experimentally compare human performance with these two HSI approaches and a baseline without human influence, across two swarm sizes.

## METHOD

We conducted an experiment where participants supervised a simulated swarm performing a foraging task. The independent variables were:

- **Interaction mode** - leader, beacon, or no influence (baseline)
- **Swarm size** - 50 or 100 robots

In leader mode, participants could select up to four robots to act as leaders that the other swarm members autonomously followed. In beacon mode, participants could place colored beacons in the environment to guide the swarm.

The dependent measures were:

- Maneuver time - how long it took the swarm to collect all targets
- Deviation from ideal path - how much the swarm path deviated from an optimal foraging path
- Workload - participant's subjective workload, measured via the NASA-TLX scale

## RESULTS

Key findings were:

- Both leader and beacon modes resulted in shorter maneuver times than the baseline.
- Beacon mode led to less deviation from an ideal path than leader mode.
- Larger swarm size increased maneuver time and path deviation.
- Human workload was higher for leader mode than beacon mode.
- Swarm size did not significantly impact workload.

## DISCUSSION

This study provides insights into human-swarm interaction, suggesting that both leader-based and beacon-based HSI can improve performance over no human influence. However, beacon-based HSI seems more effective at optimizing the swarm path and also reduces operator workload compared to directing leaders.

The choice of HSI mode may depend on swarm size, with leader-based influence potentially less effective for larger swarms. Further research should explore additional HSI paradigms and how effectiveness scales with even larger swarms.
