# Intelligence Analyst AI Workbench UI Kit - Contents Overview

The Figma UI kit for designing AI-powered tools for intelligence analysts contains the following key components and templates:

## Global Styles

- Color palette optimized for accessibility and visual encoding of data types
- Typography scales for headers, body text, data labels, and UI microcopy
- Icon set covering common actions, objects, data sources, and AI capabilities

## UI Component Library

- Faceted search widgets and filtering controls for zeroing in on relevant intel
- Configurable data table views with column controls and inline visualizations
- Charting components including histograms, scatterplots, node-link diagrams, etc.
- Geospatial map UI layers for plotting events, tracks, heatmaps, and regions of interest
- Timeline components for analyzing and annotating activity streams
- ML-powered insight and recommendation panels for surfacing key intel
- Chat UI templates for conversational interactions with AI assistants
- Workflow components for analyst-guided machine learning and task automation
- Rich text editors and knowledge capture templates for analyst notebook UIs
- Specialized components for cross-domain intel lensing and model pivots

## Page Templates

- Dashboard layouts for at-a-glance mission overviews and alerts
- Watch board interfaces for monitoring key intel targets and sources
- Linked multi-view analysis workspaces for correlating entities and discovering connections
- ML-enhanced anomaly detection and pattern matching consoles
- Domain-specific intel explorer views for diving deep into GEOINT, SIGINT, and HUMINT
- Knowledge graph visualizers for navigating ontologies and reasoning chains
- Report generation studios with AI writing assistance and template automation
- Management UIs for tuning AI models, recommendation preferences, and automation
- Personalization settings for tailoring the intel UI to each analyst's needs

All components are built with Figma's powerful variants and auto-layout features, allowing you to efficiently explore layout permutations, adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, and maintain consistent styles as you scale up your prototype.

By combining, customizing, and extending these building blocks, designers can rapidly mock up high-fidelity concepts for infusing analyst workflows with artificial intelligence - from natural language search to machine-generated insights to intelligent process automation. The kit aims to provide a fertile starting point for envisioning the next generation of human-machine collaboration in the intelligence world.
