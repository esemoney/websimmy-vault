# Intelligence Analyst AI Workbench UI Kit - Detailed Alternate Text Descriptions

This document provides in-depth textual descriptions of the key UI templates contained in the Figma kit, in order to make the design contents more accessible to users of assistive technologies or in low-bandwidth situations. Each description captures the key layout structures, UI component types, data visualization styles, and overall interaction concepts represented in the associated Figma frame.

## Mission Dashboard Template

Mission Dashboard UI Preview

The mission dashboard template provides an at-a-glance overview of key information and intelligence streams relevant to an analyst's current assignment or area of responsibility.

The top of the dashboard features a page header with the mission name, dashboard controls, and global navigation menu. Below that, the contents are divided into a 12-column grid layout containing a mix of variable-width widgets surfacing bite-sized intel insights.

The left 4 columns are devoted to a sidebar with textual mission details, a task checklist, and a filterable feed of mission-relevant SIGACTs and intelligence report snippets. The main central area contains a large map view plotting mission-relevant activity and events, plus a supervisory AI agent's dynamically prioritized alerts and recommendations.

The right side of the grid is occupied by a set of modular intel stat cards, each visualizing a KPI or metric of interest with a concise chart and caption - for example, bar graphs of message traffic volume, entity relationship mini-diagrams, timelines of key events, and heatmaps of relevant topics and keywords. These cards can be reordered, resized, or swapped out to let analysts compose bespoke dashboard views focused on their intel requirements.

Analysts can rapidly absorb curated intel highlights by skimming the dashboard from left to right, and then drill down into any item or widget that warrants closer inspection to launch more detailed analysis views and workflows. The dashboard aims to strike a balance between providing a digestible intel summary, while also serving as a launching pad for deeper context-driven investigations.

## AI-Assisted Link Analysis Workspace Template

Link Analysis Workspace UI Preview

The AI-assisted link analysis workspace is designed to help analysts uncover hidden connections and patterns across diverse intelligence streams, with machine learning agents proactively surfacing insights for human vetting and sensemaking.

The workspace is anchored by a large central graph visualization in which nodes represent key entities of interest (people, places, organizations, events, etc.) and links represent known or inferred relationships between the entities. Users can pan and zoom around the graph, select nodes and edges to inspect their details, and apply domain-specific graph layout algorithms to illuminate structures like social networks, communication patterns, or activity sequences.

A collapsible left sidebar allows analysts to search for and filter entities to add to the graph. Relevant results appear in an entity list view that can be dragged onto the graph, automatically populating links to existing graph nodes. Analysts can also manually create nodes and edges via tooltips to capture their own domain knowledge and hunches.

On the right side, a series of AI assistance panels surface machine-generated insights in response to the analyst's current focus area in the central graph - for example, recommending additional entities and links to explore based on graph topology, attributes, and ontologies; identifying potential anomalies, gaps, or discrepancies in the link schema; and auto-generating draft intel snippets capturing key facts and contexts. The analyst can tune and pin these AI recommendations to inject machine wisdom into their evolving knowledge map.

Additional tabs in the sidebar allow users to switch to timeline, geospatial, and multi-INT "lensing" views that project the focus subgraph onto other analytic frameworks like activity maps and multimedia artifact collections. This allows for rapid pivoting between representational models to stimulate new analytic vectors and surface cross-disciplinary connections.

Throughout the link analysis process, the AI agent is continuously learning from the analyst's interactions, feeding richer recommendations, and ultimately co-constructing a deeply contextualized knowledge graph that can power downstream intel summaries, operational plans, and decision-support guidance. The fluid interplay of human sensemaking and machine inference enables a powerful approach to connecting the dots and discovering unknown unknowns in complex intel challenges.
