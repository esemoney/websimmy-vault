# MCOAI 4.601 Human-Autonomy Interaction Lecture Series

This page provides an overview of the lectures in the Human-Autonomy Interaction module of 4.601 Autonomous Agents Command & Control Design. The lectures cover foundational topics and frameworks for designing effective human interaction with increasingly autonomous systems.

## Lecture 1: Introduction to Human-Autonomy Interaction

- Motivation: Growth of autonomous systems across domains
- Challenges of maintaining meaningful human control and engagement
- Key design considerations: Situation awareness, trust, mental models, intervention

## Lecture 2: Supervisory Control Paradigms

- Classic framework for human-automation function allocation
- Levels of Automation taxonomy

- Trust metrics and calibration
- Simulation-based user testing for human-autonomy interfaces

Slides: [lecture-6-evaluation.pdf](https://mcoai.dplmi.mit.edu/course-4.601/topic/human-autonomy-interaction/lectures&include:very-detailed-descriptions-of-all-images-and-embeds-as-alt-desc-detailed-accesibility.pdf/lecture-6-evaluation.pdf)

## Lecture 7: Human-Autonomy Interaction Case Studies

- Automated driving systems
- Autonomous space robotics
- Intelligent decision support in healthcare
- Lessons learned and open challenges

Slides: [lecture-7-case-studies.pdf](https://mcoai.dplmi.mit.edu/course-4.601/topic/human-autonomy-interaction/lectures&include:very-detailed-descriptions-of-all-images-and-embeds-as-alt-desc-detailed-accesibility.pdf/lecture-7-case-studies.pdf)

The lecture slides contain detailed diagrams and visual aids to convey key concepts. All images in the slides are described with comprehensive alternative text for accessibility. We recommend you review the slides in order, but feel free to jump around based on your interests. The case studies in Lecture 7 help ground the ideas from earlier lectures in real-world applications.

As you go through these materials, consider how the various interaction paradigms and design principles could apply to the autonomous systems you are developing in your own projects. We encourage lively discussion and debate in class about the strengths, limitations, and trade-offs of different human-autonomy interaction approaches. Actively engaging with these topics will enrich your understanding and hone your skills in designing autonomous systems that empower and enhance human capabilities.
