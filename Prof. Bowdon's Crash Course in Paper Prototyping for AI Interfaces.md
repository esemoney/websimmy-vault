# Prof. Bowdon's Crash Course in Paper Prototyping for AI Interfaces

Welcome, intrepid interaction designers! If you're looking for a fast, flexible, and dare I say fun way to explore design ideas for AI-powered interfaces, you've come to the right place. Paper prototyping is an oldie but a goodie - a low-fidelity technique that can yield high-impact insights with minimal investment. In this crash course, we'll cover the why, what, and how of putting paper prototyping to work for your AI interface projects.

## Why Paper Prototype?

When you're venturing into the uncharted territory of designing for human-AI interaction, it's all too easy to get bogged down in the technical complexities and lose sight of the big picture. Paper prototyping keeps you focused on the core user experience:

- **Rapid iteration:** With paper, you can create and test a new design idea in minutes, not days. Sketch, simulate, learn, repeat.
- **Collaborative ideation:** Paper is an inherently social medium. Huddling around a sketch to spitball ideas sparks creative energy like nothing else.
- **Clarifying communication:** Seeing a design come to life on paper, even roughly, is worth a thousand abstract discussions. Paper prototypes get teams aligned around a shared vision.
- **Early user insight:** Testing a paper prototype reveals issues you'd never anticipate - and at a fraction of the cost of testing a coded interface.

In short, paper prototyping is your secret weapon for nimble, user-centered design in the face of daunting complexity. Wield it wisely!

## Paper Prototyping 101

Convinced of the paper prototyping magic? Here's a step-by-step guide to running your own session:

1. **Gather your supplies:** No fancy equipment needed - just grab some paper, pens, markers, Post-Its, scissors, and maybe some scotch tape or glue sticks for good measure.
2. **Sketch key screens:** Start by mapping out the main screens or views in your interface. Focus on layout and info hierarchy, not pretty details. Use arrows or numbers to indicate flow.
3. **Create elements:** Cut out or sketch interactive components like buttons, menus, cards, and windows. No need for pixel perfection - scrappy is fine as long as the function is clear.
4. **Simulate the AI:** This is the fun part! Use cards, chits, or even just quick sketches to represent AI outputs like recommendations or alerts. Shuffle and swap them to mimic dynamic behavior.
5. **Role-play scenarios:** Grab a buddy and play out realistic user flows, moving the paper bits as you go. "Think aloud" to surface expectations and trouble spots.
6. **Iterate and refine:** As issues emerge, sketch alternate solutions on the fly. Keep what works, toss what doesn't, and evolve your prototype in realtime.

That's it! Of course, the devil is in the details, so here are some pro tips to level up your paper prototyping chops:

### Paper Prototyping Pro Tips

- **Embrace the roughness:** Polished visuals actually work against you in paper prototyping. Crude sketches invite critique and dissipate attachment to any one idea.
- **Color-code with care:** Spare use of color (e.g. red for errors, green for success) can quickly convey key states. But keep it minimal to avoid distraction.
- **Prototype the AI "beneath:"** Don't just show AI outputs, simulate how they change with different user inputs. Dynamic behavior is the crux of human-AI interaction.
- **Capture and synthesize:** Post-session, snap pics of your marked-up sketches. Consolidate key insights and share widely to maintain momentum.
- **Know when to go higher-fi:** Paper is perfect for early discovery, but can't answer every question. Let your prototype evolve towards interactive mockups as your design solidifies.

## Paper Prototyping for AI Interfaces: An Example

Let's make this concrete with an example from a recent class project - designing a planning interface for an AI-assisted disaster response system. The initial paper prototype looked something like this:

Sticky notes and annotations cover the sketches, indicating revisions and ideas generated during a prototyping session.

Paper prototype sketches for an AI disaster response planning tool.

Key things we were able to test and iterate at this early stage:

- How to visually represent the AI's suggested resource allocations and route plans on the map.
- What interaction modalities allow the user to understand and adjust the AI's parameters.
- How to convey the system's dynamic projections and uncertainties as conditions evolve.
- Where to place status readouts, alert flags, and decision support features for max usability.

Simulating these flows with our paper screens revealed issues and generated new ideas far faster than diving straight into interface code. With more targeted questions in hand, the team was then able to craft higher-fidelity prototypes that landed on a battle-tested design.

## Now It's Your Turn!

Paper prototyping for AI interfaces is as much art as science - the kind of skill you only develop through hands-on practice. So round up some markers, wrangle a few test users, and get sketching! The pages may be disposable, but the insights you'll gain are anything but.

Happy prototyping,  
Prof. Bowdon
