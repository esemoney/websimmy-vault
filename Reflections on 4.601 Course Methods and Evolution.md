# Dear Students,

## Reflections on 4.601 Course Methods and Evolution

As we wrap up another thought-provoking semester of the Designing & Prototyping C2 Interfaces for Autonomous Agents course, I wanted to share some reflections on how the course has evolved, the methods and tools we've found most effective, and where we might go from here in preparing you to grapple with the critical challenges at the intersection of human and machine agency in military systems.

When we first launched this course offering in 2023, the domain of human-autonomy interaction design in military contexts was still an emerging frontier. The case studies and readings we could draw from were largely speculative or very early stage. Fast forward to today, and the landscape has transformed dramatically. The accelerating real-world deployments of AI-enabled weapon systems and the intense debates they have sparked around human control, accountability, and ethics have brought an urgency and tangibility to the questions at the heart of this course that simply didn't exist a few years ago.

In response to this new reality, we've continuously evolved the curriculum to arm you with the conceptual frameworks, interaction design approaches, prototyping tools, and ethical best practices to take on these high-stakes challenges. Some key shifts:

- Bringing in more case studies and guest speakers with first-hand experience operating AI-enabled systems in the field to ground our discussions in operational realities
- Emphasizing interactive prototyping much earlier in the design process to surface edge cases and test assumptions about human-AI task allocation
- Shifting programming projects to game engine environments to enable more realistic and militarily-relevant simulations
- Expanding coverage of AI security and robustness to consider how interfaces can mitigate or inadvertently enable novel failure modes
- Introducing "red teaming" exercises where you probe each other's interface designs for hidden gaps that could be exploited by an adversary

Through it all, the core emphasis remains equipping you to thoughtfully navigate the often competing priorities of efficacy, safety, control, transparency, and scalability in these human-AI interaction contexts. Watching you wrestle with these tensions and come up with creative approaches to strike the right balances has been immensely rewarding.

> "These military AI systems are going to reshape the human role in warfare in profound ways we're just beginning to grapple with. It's on us to proactively steer their development and deployment in wise and ethical directions. That's the mindset and skillset we're aiming to cultivate in this course."

Looking ahead, I'm excited to further enhance the course with:

- Partnerships to give you access to AR/VR interfaces for even more immersive C2 prototyping
- Deeper dives into the AI techniques powering these systems so you can design interfaces that harness them effectively and responsibly
- More content on the policy and governance frameworks needed to ensure meaningful human control and accountability

I learn something new every semester from your questions, insights and design innovations. Thank you for bringing your full creativity and conscientiousness to this critical domain. I look forward to continuing to explore this ever-evolving frontier together in the years to come.

Onward,  
Prof. Jane Doe
