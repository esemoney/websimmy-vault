# Spotlight Series: Deep Dives into HAII Design Topics

Welcome to the Spotlight series within our Human-AI Interaction (HAII) design course! In this ongoing collection of deep dives, we zoom in on specific interaction patterns, techniques, and challenges that arise when crafting user experiences for AI-powered systems.

Each spotlight installment focuses on a particular theme, breaking down nuances and best practices in an accessible yet rigorous way. We combine conceptual frameworks, case studies, and plenty of illustrated examples to build your HAII design toolkit piece by piece.

> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." - Arthur C. Clarke

The Spotlights aim to dispel this sense of mystery around AI by equipping designers with concrete, actionable insights they can apply directly to their HAII projects. Through deep yet practical exploration, we want to empower you to wield the "magic" of AI interaction design with intentionality and skill.

### A Living Collection

The Spotlight series is ever-evolving, with new installments added regularly based on student interest, industry developments, and emerging research. We encourage you to check back often and even suggest topics you'd like to see covered.

Whether you binge-read them all or dip in tactically, we hope the Spotlights become a go-to resource to level up your AI interaction design chops. So grab your HAII hat and magnifying glass, and let's dive deep together!

## Contribute

Is there an HAII design topic you're passionate about that's not yet covered in the Spotlights? Or do you have an AI interface case study you'd like to share with the community? We welcome contributed Spotlights from students, practitioners, and researchers looking to advance the field.

To pitch a Spotlight idea or submit a draft, email us your background & topic proposal at [[email protected]](https://dplmi.mit.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We'll work with you to shape your insight into an accessible, visual installment that helps designers everywhere create more thoughtful human-AI interactions.

> "The beauty of good interaction design is that it becomes invisible. The user doesn't think about the interface, they think with the interface – it empowers their cognition and creativity. With AI, we have a chance to craft interactions so fluid, they feel like an extension of the user's own mind. That's the bar we should aim for."

These are still early days for HAII, with much uncharted territory to explore. The Spotlights are our attempt to map this new frontier, one interaction design challenge at a time. We hope you'll join us on the journey and help light the way!
