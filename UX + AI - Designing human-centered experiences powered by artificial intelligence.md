### About this resource

As artificial intelligence becomes an increasingly integral part of products and services, it's critical that designers understand how to create AI-powered experiences that are deeply human-centered. This resource aims to help UX practitioners get started with designing AI, providing an introduction to key concepts, principles, patterns and practices for creating interfaces and interactions that put people at the center of AI-driven products.

### AI Design Principles

#### Augment, don't automate

AI should enhance and empower human capabilities, not attempt to replace them. Look for ways AI can assist and enrich the user experience, while keeping the human firmly in control.

#### Be transparent and accountable

Make it clear to users when they are interacting with an AI system. Provide explanations of how the AI arrives at its outputs, and give users recourse if something goes wrong. Foster trust through transparency and accountability.

#### Design for dynamic experience

AI-powered interfaces evolve and adapt based on user inputs and contextual factors. Embrace variability and design UI flows that can gracefully handle different paths based on the AI's inferences and user choices.

#### Respect privacy and data rights

AI systems rely on user data to function. Put guardrails in place to protect user privacy, provide data controls, and ensure AI is being used ethically. Help users understand their data rights.

### AI Experience Patterns

#### Onboarding & Expectation Setting

Build user confidence by clearly communicating what the AI can and cannot do upfront. Calibrate expectations through guided onboarding and in-context education.

#### Explicit AI Handoff & Takeover

Provide clear affordances and moments of consent when handing off control between the user and AI. Ensure it's effortless to interrupt automation and resume manual control.

#### Explanations & Rationale

Surface concise, contextual explanations of how the AI arrives at its decisions and predictions. Let users peek behind the curtain to build understanding and trust.

#### Feedback & Correction

Allow users to easily provide input to tune and correct AI outputs. Treat user feedback as a first-class citizen and make it effortless to inject human judgment into the system.

### AI-Centric Design Practices

- **Understand the AI's abilities and constraints.** Work closely with data scientists and engineers to grasp the AI model's strengths, limitations, and failure modes. Design the UX to play to the AI's strengths while mitigating its weaknesses.
- **Prototype with real data and interactions.** Test designs with actual AI models and datasets as early as possible. Understand how the AI experience feels with real user input and edge cases, not just ideal scenarios.
- **Design the full experience loop.** Map the end-to-end user journey, considering how AI insights will be surfaced, acted upon, and improved over time. Design feedback mechanisms that create a virtuous cycle between user actions and AI refinements.
- **Plan for variability and adaptation.** Expect the AI model and experience to evolve based on new data and user behaviors. Design modular and adaptive UIs that can gracefully adjust as the underlying AI changes.
- **Advocate for fairness, accountability and transparency.** Scrutinize training data and model outcomes for problematic biases. Partner with legal and ethics experts to stress-test the UX for potential negative impacts or misuse. Give users visibility into how their data is being leveraged.
